*the text in `()` below is *why* each step is assigned*

1. review today's notes after they are posted, both rendered and the raw markdown versions. Include links to both views in your badge PR comment. (to review)
1. read Chapter 1, "Decoding your confusion while coding" in [The Programmer's Brain](https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain#toc) add a file called {index}`brain.md` to your kwl repo that summarizes your thoughts on the chapter. Do you think this information will help you approach learning more effectively? why or why not? How, if at all, does it changes how you think about debugging and learning to program? Give examples of how you have encountered the different types of confusion in your prior programming experiences. (to help you get good strategies and prime for things we will see in the next few weeks)
2. ["Watch"](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) the [course website repo](https://github.com/compsys-progtools/fall2024), specifically watch Releases under custom  (to get notifications)
3. map out your computing knowledge and add it to your kwl chart repo in a file called {index}`prior-knowledge-map.md`. Use [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) syntax, to draw your map. GitHub can render it for you including while you work using the preview button. (what we will learn will connect a lot of ideas, mapping out where you start, sets you up for success)
4. Read more about [version control in general](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) and add a "version control" row to your KWL chart with all 3 columns filled in. (git is version control, but not the only one)
