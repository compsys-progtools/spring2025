1. Create a merge conflict in your KWL repo on the branch for this issue and resolve it using your favorite IDE, then create one and resolve it on GitHub in browser (this requires the merge conflict to occur on a PR). Describe how you created it, show the files, and describe how your IDE helps or does not help in {index}`merge_conflict_comparison.md`. Give advice for when you think someone should resolve a merge conflict in GitHub vs using an IDE. (if you do not regulary use an, IDE, try VSCode) *You can put content in the file for this step for the purpose of making the merge conflicts for this exercise.* 
2.  Learn about [GitHub forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks) and more about [git branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)(you can also use other resources)
3. In {index}`branches-forks.md` in your KWL repo, compare and contrast branches and forks; be specific about their relationship. You may use mermaid diagrams if that helps you think through or communicate the ideas. If you use other resources, include them in your file as markdown links.
