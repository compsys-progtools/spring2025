1. [ ] Look over the class notes and answer the following in a file called `cat.md`

What happens if we typed the command 
```bash
cat
```
exactly as is. Feel free to test it on your terminal.

Tell me what the `--help` message told you regarding the command being run like so. 
And give me a brief explaination in your own words of what that means.

1. [ ] Use the option `-h`/`--help` with one command that we've with so far. Read the explaination thoroughly and write a short report in a file named `command-help.md` that explains your findings.

## Reflection

<!-- Was there anything about the use of this command that you didn't know before doing this activity and thought was cool? -->

<!-- Did you find hardship reading the documentation for the command? -->

<!-- Did you do this for more than one command? Type the other commands you've used the `-h` option with and anything cool that you found -->
