1. Review the notes, [jupyterbook docs](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), and experiment with the `jupyter-book` CLI to determine what files are required to make `jupyter-book build` run. Make your kwl repo into a jupyter book. Set it so that the `_build` directory is not under version control. 
2. Learn about the documentation ecosystem in another language that you know using at least one official source and additional sources as you find helpful. In `docs-practice.md` include a summary of your findings and compare and contrast it to jupyter book/sphinx.  Include a [bibtex based bibliography](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/citations.html) of the sources you used. You can use [this generator](https://url-to-bibtex.vercel.app/) for informal sources and [google scholar](https://digitalmeasures.oregonstate.edu/training/export-bibtex-google-scholar) for formal sources (or a reference manager).
