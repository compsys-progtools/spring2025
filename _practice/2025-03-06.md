1. Read about different workflows in git and add responses to the below in a {index}`workflows.md` in your kwl repo. Two good places to read from are [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows#ch05-distributed-git) and the [atlassian Docs](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
2. Update your kwl chart with what you have learned or new questions in the want to know column
3. Separate from what you added from the previous step. Add to your kwl table the following rows and fill them out. `git branches`, `merge conflicts`, `commits`. Try to include an older understanding about them in the `know` column and a newer understanding in the `learned` column
4. Add the hash of the content of your completed {index}`workflows.md` file and put that in the comment of your badge PR for this badge. *Try to do this from your local CLI, but full credit even if you use the website interface*

## Workflow Reflection

1. Why is it important that git can be used with different workflows?
1. Which workflow do you think you would like to work with best and why?
1. Describe a scenario that might make it better for the whole team to use a workflow other than the one you prefer.
