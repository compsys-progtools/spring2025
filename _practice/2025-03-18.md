1. Read more details about [git internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) to review what we did in class in greater detail. Make a file {index}`gitplumbingdetail.md` and create a a table or mermaid diagram that shows the relationship between at least **three** porcelain commands and their corresponding plumbing commands (generally more than one each). 
2. Create {index}`gitislike.md` and explain main git operations we have seen (add, commit, push) in your own words in a way that will either help you remember or how you would explain it to someone else at a high level. This might be analogies or explanations using other programming concepts or concepts from a hobby.
