1. Update your KWL Chart learned column with what you've learned
2. prevent `badges.json` and `badges.yml` from being tracked by git in your kwl repo
3. write a bash script that prevents `jupyter-book` from giving warnings about files not having a heading by using the file name as a temporary title. (see the badge from 03/04 where you should have converted your repo, or do that one first, this counts as an extension on that if you have not done it)
   
Hint: Use [`sed`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html)'s insert option and [head](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/head.1.html) as needed. 


## Explore idea

modify your script to use [a small llm from ollama](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2) to automatically insert a sensible title by summarizing the file. **using a commercial chat interface does not qualify, but using an llm locally does**

1. Write a bash script that updates your badges.json file and then generates your progress report using [courseutils](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/courseutils/index.html) and posts it as an issue  *we will use this in lab next week*

2. Write a bash script generates a progress report and computes your current grade using [courseutils](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/courseutils/index.html) and posts it as an issue *we will use this in lab next week*

*hint* you might use a temp file that you would also not want to track
