This is an [integrative](integrative) 2x badge. 
```

1.  File permissions are represented numerically often in octal, by transforming the permissions for each level (owner, group, all) as binary into a number. Add {index}`octal.md` to your KWL repo and answer the following. Try to think through it on your own, but you may look up the answers, as long as you link to (or ideally cite using jupyterbook citations) a high quality source.
    ```
    1. Describe how to transform the permissions [`r--`, `rw-`, `rwx`] to octal, by treating each set as three bits.
    1. Transform the permission we changed our script to `rwxr-xr-x` to octal.
    1. Which of the following would prevent a file from being edited by other people 777 or 755 and why?
    ```
2. configure [ssh keys for your github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
3. Read through this [rsa encryption demo site](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kirk/cs1501/notes/rsademo/) site and use it to show what, for a particular public/private key pair (based on small primes) it would look like to pass a message, "It is spring now!" encrypted.  (that is encypt it, and decrypt it with the site, show it's encrypted version and the key pair and describe what would go where). Put your example in {index}`rsademo.md`.
4. Find 2 other encyrption algorithms that could be used wiht ssh (hint: try `man ssh` or [read it online](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh.1.html)) and compare them in {index}`encyryption_compare.md`.  Your comparison should be enough to advise someone which is best and why, but need not get into the details.
