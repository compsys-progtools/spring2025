1. Write a bash script {index}`demo_test.sh` that runs your compiled program for each integer from 10 to 30 (syntax for a range is `{start..end}` so this would be `{10..30}`)
2. Write a bash script, {index}`assembly.sh` to compile each program to assembly and print the number of lines in each file.  
3. Put the output of your script in {index}`hello_assembly_compare.md`. Add to the file some notes on how they are similar or different based on your own reading of them.
4. use [scp](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/comp/security/scp_man.html) to download your modified main, script files, and output to your local computer and include them in your kwl repo.
