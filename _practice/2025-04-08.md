```{important}
This is an [integrative](integrative) 2x badge. 
```


The first four tasks are the practice task, then there are two pre-approved explore badge ideas.  Hover it on your issue to create an independent issue to track it.  Title the new issue `Explore: IDE`. On the explore badge, when it is ready for submission, request a review from Ayman. 

1. In {index}`bestide.md`, compare two IDEs using your group's table from class, to evaluate each of them.  Your review should have an introduction that justifies the ranking and defines the criteria, a section describing each IDE with respect to all of the criteria and your overall experience with that IDE, and a conclusion that explains which of the 3 is the best based on your evaluation. 
2. Configure your VS Code preferences to your github account. add {index}`settingssync.md` with a description of what settings you customized and synced and reflect on why this is an important feature and what prerequisites to it might be.
3. Describe a type of project where it would be worth it for you to learn a language you have never used before in {index}`newlanguage.md` This should be based in what types of features for the language your project would require and/or what would contribute to the long term health of the project. Your justifiction must come from sources used in class and be based in factual evidence about the language. 
4. Learn about one of the following languages that you have not used before: [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started), [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) or another language you are curious about that appeared in the Developer survey. For example you might be interest in the [top paying languages](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-top-paying-technologies). Use the official documentation.  Answer the following questions in {index}`languagelearning.md`:

    ```
    1. What is this language designed for?
    2. What Programming paradigm(s) does it support?
    3. Give at least 1 example of a programming language that experience in would make it **easy** to learn this language and explain why. 
    4. Give at least 1 example of a programming language that experience in would make it **hard** to learn this language and explain why. 
    5. What is its most unique feature(s)?
    ```

hint: for questions 3 & 4, for example learning Python first does not make it easy to learn C++, but learning C makes it very easy to learn C++ (but I have not filled in explanations). 

## Explore badge option 1

Create a small repo owned by compsys-progtools named `ide-USERNAME` where `USERNAME` is your gh username with some example code, a vscode/codespace [devcontainer file](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers) that installs [CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) and your favorite extension(s).  Write a CodeTour that walks someone through using your favorite extension to do something with the code. 
The example code can be any language, can be very simple, can even have a bug in it if that helps your example. You can use an-IDE integrated LLM (eg GitHub Co-pilot, not the chat version) to generate some code for this purpose if you do not have some available to you already, but you cannot share solutions to a course assignment without that instructor's permission.

## Explore badge option 2

Actually try out one of the langauges above in a new repo created from [this asssignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/XoqjPVBp). 

**work on a branch and commit after each step**

1. Setup the devcontainer to provide the compiler/interpreter for the language of your choice. See [features](https://containers.dev/features)
2. Add top extensions related to the language to the devcontainer. 
3. Add a [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore) file for that language
4. Write a hello world type program in the language and make sure it runs. 
5. Use the official documentation to figure out a common task in the language and write an example program that completes something typical for that language (eg a sort data analysis in R). You may use GitHub Co-pilot in the code space to help write the code, but you should justify the task you ask it to do. Commit any generated code immediately with the message "code from copilot via <prompt>" and your prompt filled in.  
6. Test your understanding of the code by trying to modify it, and make commits describing what you changed and why. 
7. Fill in the prompts in the README (follow the comments) and Answer the questions in the README of the template repo.
