_hover over the explore ones and to make an issue if you want to work on that explore_
1. While we saw many types of gates today, but we actually could get all of the operations needed using only NAND gates. Work out how to use NAND gates to implement a half adder and describe it in {index}`nandhalf.md`
2. In {index}`addertypes.md` compare ripple adders and lookahead adders.
    ```
    1. Give a synopsis of each adder type
    2. Compare them in terms of time (assume that each gate requires one unit of time)
    3. Compare them in terms of space/cost by counting the total number of gates required.
    ```
3. Experiment with bitwise operators in python to derive 3 generic rules. Submit in `bitwise_expt.md` that has code in cells and the output (eg like the notes). An example (that you cannot get credit for) is any number xor with itself is 0, or `a^a =0`.  


- [ ] explore: Learn about the alternative to these operations for quantum computing and compare and think about how we would need to change computing operations for quantum compared to the traditional gates we have been using
- [ ] explore: for another application of bitwsie operations, design and describe an activity
