1. Find the glossary page for the course website, link it below. Review the terms for the next class: shell, terminal, bash, git, zsh, powershell, GitHub. Make a diagram using [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html) to highlight how these terms relate to one another. Put this in a file called `terminal-vocab.md` on a branch linked to this issue. 
2. Check your kwl repo before class and see if you have recieved feedback, reply or merge accordingly.
