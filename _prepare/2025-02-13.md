1. Bring git questions or scenarios you want to be able to solve to class on Thursday (in your mind or comment here if that helps you remember)

2. Try read and understand the workflow files in your KWL repo, the goal is not to be sure you understand every step, but to get an idea about the big picture ideas and just enough to complete the following. Try to modify files, on a prepare branch, so that your name is already filled in when your experience badge (inclass)/Forgotten/ and Makeup action runs. We will give the answer in class, but especially do not do this step on the main branch it could break your action.
