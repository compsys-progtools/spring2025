Examine an open source software project and fill in the template below in a file called {index}`software.md` in your kwl repo on a branch that is linked to this issue. You do not need to try to understand how the *code* works for this exercise, but instead focus on how the repo is set up, what additional information is in there beyond the code.  You may pick any mature open source project, meaning a project with recent commits, active PRs and issues, multiple contributors. In class we will have a discussion and you will compare what you found with people who examined a different project.  Coordinate with peers (eg using the class discussion or in lab time) to look at different projects in order to discuss together in class.
