1. Take a few minutes to think what you know about hashing and numbers. Create {index}`hash_num_prep.md` with two sections: `## Hashing` with a few bullet points summarzing key points about hashing, and `## Numbers` with what types of number representations you know. 
2. Review notes from [How do git branches work](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/spring2025/notes/2025-02-11.html). Focus on resolving merge conflict in preperation to next lab.
3. Review notes from [What is a commit](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/spring2025/notes/2025-02-18.html) & [What is git](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/spring2025/notes/2025-03-06.html) (Both notes should be fixed by 3/10) to be fully prepared for this class after a nice break. Bring questions if you come up with any. You may qualify for a community badge if you post/contribute in a [discussion thread](https://github.com/orgs/compsys-progtools/discussions/categories/class-discussions) related to the concepts mentioned in said classes if your ask meaningful questions that your classmates feel intrigued to discuss.
