- [ ] Review the GitHub Action [file from last lab](https://github.com/compsys-progtools/collab/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate_problem.yml) and make note of what if any syntax in there is unfamilar.  (note that link will not work on the rendered website, but will work on badge issues)
- [ ] Use quote reply or edit to see how I made a relative path to a location within the repo in this issue. (to see another application of paths)
- [ ] Check out the [github action marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) to see other actions that are available and try to get a casual level of understanding of the *types* of things that people use actions for.
