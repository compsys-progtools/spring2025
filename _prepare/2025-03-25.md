1. Read the notes from March 18th. We will build on these directly in the future. **You need to have the `test` repo with the same status as me**  
2. Add to your IDE {index}`idethoughts.md` file if you have not in a few days on a dedicated `ide_prep` branch. **This is prep for after a few weeks from now, **not for 03/25**; keep this branch open until it is specifically asked for**
    * I have not posted an outline for {index}`idethoughts.md`. Start with sections like `preference`, `debugging metods`, `organizations`, `tools/extentions` Add any other thoughts on using different IDEs you can think of. These sections are not limiting nor are they mandated
