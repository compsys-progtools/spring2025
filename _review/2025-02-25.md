1. Read today's notes when they are posted. There are imporant tips and explanation to be sure you did.
2. Most real projects partly adhere and at least partly deviate from any major design philosophy or paradigm. Review the open source project you looked at for the `software.md` file from before and decide if it primarily  adheres to or deviates from the unix philosophy. Add a `## Unix Philosophy <Adherance/Deviation>` section to your {index}`software.md`, setting the title to indicate your decision and explain your decision in that section (pick one). Provide at least two specific examples supporting your choice, using links to specific lines of code or specific sections in the documentation that support your claims.
