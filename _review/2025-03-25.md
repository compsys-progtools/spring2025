- [ ] Read about the Learn more about the [SHA-1 collision attach](https://shattered.io/) 

- [ ] Calculate the maximum number of git objects that a repo can have without requiring you to use more than the minimum number of characters to refer to any object (the minimum is 4. That's usually enough for us to use something like `cat-file` command, `git tag` or even `git checkout`)and include that number in  {index}`gitcounts.md`  with a title `# Git counts`. How many files would have to exist to reach that number of objects assuming every fiile was edited in each of two commits? *If you get stuck, outline what you know and then request a review.* 


- [ ] Create {index}`tagtypeexplore.md`  with the template below. Determine how  many of the tags in the course website are annotated vs lightweight using. (You may need to use `git pull --tags` in your clone of the course website)
