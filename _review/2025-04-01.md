1. Create some variations of the `hello.c` we made in class. Make {index}`hello2.c` print twice with 2 print commands. Make {index}`hello5.c` print 5 times with a for loop and {index}`hello7.c` print 7 times with a for loop. Build them all on the command line and make sure they run correctly. 
2. Write a bash script, {index}`assembly.sh` to compile each program to assembly and print the number of lines in each file.  
3. use [scp](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/comp/security/scp_man.html) to download your modified main, script files, and output to your local computer and include them in your kwl repo.
