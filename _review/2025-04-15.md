1. While we saw many types of gates today, but we actually could get all of the operations needed using only NAND gates. Work out how to use NAND gates to implement `and` and `or` in {index}`nandandor.md`
1. Find what bitwise operation would complete each of these transformations (eg `1 << 3 = 4` and `4^4 = 0`) that is replace the ? with a bitwise operator. For each show work to explain how you found it in `bitwise.md`:
   ```
   4 ? 3 = 32
   11 ? 7 = 3
   8 ? 2 = 2
   ```
