# How do programmers communicate about code? 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Commit messages are essential 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

A git commit message must exist and is always for people, but can also be for machines. 


The [conventional commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a format of commits

If you use this, then you can use automated tools to generate a full change log when you release code

[Tooling and examples of conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/about/)



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

That is a core example of the types of detailed communication we do in programming that is embedded into the work. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Where else have you seen how communication *about* the work shape the work


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Why Documentation

Today we will talk about documentation, there are several reasons this is important: 
- **using** official documentation is the best way to get better at the tools
- understanding how documentation is designed and built will help you use it better
- **writing** and  **maintaining** documentation is really important part of working on a team
- documentation building tools are a type of developer tool (and these are generally good software design)
  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Design is best learned from examples. Some of the best examples of software *design* come from developer tools. 

- [source (js version)](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)
- [source (python version)](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/)






+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

In particular documentation tools are really good examples of: 
- pattern matching
- modularity and abstraction
- automation
- the build process beyond compiling



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"outcomes"}

By the end of today's class you will be able to:
- describe different types of documentation
- find different information in a code repo
- generate documentation as html 
- create a repo locally and push to GitHub

Plus we will reinforce things we have already seen: 
- ignoring content from a repo
- paths
- good file naming

## What is documentation 

[documentation types table](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1/tables/1)

from [ethnography of docuemtnation data science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1)





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why is documentation so important?

we should probably spend more time on it

![differenc ein time spent vs should](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10606-018-9333-1/MediaObjects/10606_2018_9333_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp)

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## So, *how* do we do it? 

Different types of documentation live in different places and we can use tools to maintain them. 

As developers, we rely on code to do things that are easy for computers and hard for people. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

[Documenation Tools](https://docathon.github.io/docathon/pages/resources.html#documentation-tools)



[write the docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/)

[linux kernel uses sphinx](https://lwn.net/Articles/705224/) and here is [why](https://lwn.net/Articles/692704/) and [how it works](https://lwn.net/Articles/692705/)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Why is there so much emphasis on documentation?

Back in the early days of programming, developers were primarily focused on writing code and achieving functional results. There were no established disciplines that enforced best practices for testing, modularity, or documentation.

As a result, programmers often wrote large, complex chunks of code with little to no explanation of how they worked. Variable names were frequently arbitrary, such as `1`, `2`, `a`, `b`, `z`, or `s`providing no meaningful context.

Do those names convey anything useful to you? Probably not. Now, imagine encountering them in a 500+ line program. The only way to understand their purpose would be to manually track every instance of their useâ€”an exhausting and error-prone process.

This lack of clarity led to major challenges in code maintenance, collaboration, and debugging. As software development evolved, so did the need for structured documentation. Today, well-documented code is considered a best practice, ensuring that projects remain understandable, scalable, and maintainable over time.


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Jupyterbook 

[Jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) wraps sphinx and uses markdown instead of restructured text. The project authors [note in the documenation](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/explain/sphinx.html) that it "can be thought of as an *opinionated distribution of Sphinx*". We're going to use this on our kwl repos. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

navigate to your  folder for this course (mine is `Documents/systems`)
```bash
cd Documents/systems/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can confirm that `jupyter-book` is installed by checking the version. 

```bash
jupyter-book --version
```

```
$ jupyter-book --version
Jupyter Book      : 1.0.3
External ToC      : 1.0.1
MyST-Parser       : 2.0.0
MyST-NB           : 1.2.0
Sphinx Book Theme : 1.1.4
Jupyter-Cache     : 1.0.1
NbClient          : 0.10.2
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will run a command to create a jupyterbook from a template, the command has 3 parts: 
- `jupyter-book` is a program (the thing we installed)
- `create` is a subcommand (one action that program can do)
- `tiny-book` is an argument (a mandatory input to that action)


```
jupyter-book create tiny-book
```


+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"margin"}

````{margin}
```{tip}
This is *structurally* similar to `git add .`

- `git` is a program
- `add` is a subcommand
- `.` is a path, and an argument
```
````


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    tiny-book/

===============================================================================

```
We see that it succeeds


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


You can make it with any name: 
```bash
jupyter-book create examplew
```

```
===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    examplew\

===============================================================================
```


beacuse the name is an argument or input

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Each one makes a directory, we can see by listing

```bash
ls
```
```
examplew/            spring25-kwl-AymanBx/
gh-inclass-AymanBx/  tiny-book/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

And we can delete the second one since we do not actually want it. 

```bash
rm examplew/
```
```
rm: examplew/: is a directory
```

we get an error because it is not well defined to delete a directory, and potentially risky, so `rm` is written to throw an error

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Usually to **r**e**m**ove a **d**irectory with the `rm` command we use the `-d` option

```bash
rm -d examplew/
```
```
rm: cannot remove 'examplew/': Directory not empty
```

Notice, we still got an error, but this time the error is different, It's telling us that the directory isn't empty. So this means the `-d` option is only for empty directories.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Instead, we have to tell it two additional things: 
- to delete recusively `r`
- to force it to do something risky with `f` (not really neccessary for this situation)
  
*note* we can stack single character options together with a single `-`. This means 
```bash
rm -rf examplew/
```

We use the `-r` because we're not just deleting `examplew/`.
We're deleting 
`examplew/_toc.yml`
`examplew/_configure.yml`
`examplew/requirements.txt`
`examplew/...`
`.`
`.`
`.`

And that's why the need the recursion.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
cd tiny-book/
ls

_toc.yml     markdown-notebooks.md  references.bib
intro.md     markdown.md            requirements.txt
```

What happens if I used the `-a` option? We list **a**ll files, including hidden ones.
What about `-l`? It actually lists all files in a list one item at a line with some more details about each file on the same line. Details related to write/read permissions on the file, owner of file and what not..

And because we can stack single letter options together we can do
```bash
ls -la

### Structure of a Jupyter book


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We will explore the output by looking at the files
```
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
_config.yml		logo.png		notebooks.ipynb
_toc.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	references.bib
intro.md		markdown.md		requirements.txt
```

A jupyter book has two required files (`_config.yml` and `_toc.yml`), some for content, and some helpers that are common but not required. 

- [config defaults](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html#configuration-defaults)
- [toc file formatting rules](https://jupyterbook.org/structure/toc.html#structure-of-a-book)
- the `*.md` files are content
- the `.bib` file is bibiolography information
- The other files are optional, but common. [Requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) is the format for pip to install python depndencies. There are different standards in other languages for how to specify requirenments and organize files that make up a `packege`



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}


the extention (`.yml`) is [yaml](https://yaml.org/), which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It consists of key, value pairs and is deigned to be a human-friendly way to encode data for use in any programming language.

### Dev tools mean we do not have to write bibliographies manually

bibliographies are generated with [bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org/) which takes structured information from the references in a [bibtex file](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) with help from [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

For general reference, reference managers like [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) can track all of your sources and output the references in bibtex format that you can use anywhere or sync with tools like MS Word or Google Docs. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
cat _config.yml 
```
```

Compared to what we saw on the example configure file in the documentation of Jupyter-book  posted in the link earlier. This looks pretty similar, missing the explaining comments at the end of every line. But here since this is YOUR book, you can edit the name, the author, copyright and whatnot...


The configuration file, tells jupyter-book basic iformation about the book, it provides all of the settings that jupyterbook and sphinx need to render the content as whatever output format we want.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


The table of contents file describe how to put the other files in order.


```bash
cat _toc.yml 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}


```yaml
:linenos:
# Table of contents
# Learn more at https://jupyterbook.org/customize/toc.html
```
The first two lines are comments, the pound sign `#` is a comment in bash and 
YAML. Here, the developers chose, in the template to put information about how to
set up this file right in the template file.  This is developers helping their users!


```yaml
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 4
format: jb-book
root: intro
```
The next two lines are key value pairs that tell the high level settings


```yaml
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 6
chapters:
- file: markdown
- file: notebooks
- file: markdown-notebooks
```

the end of the file shows a list of files that will be treated as chapters.  This is also the syntax
for a list in YAML, the list is named `chapters` and each item, starting with a `-` has a single key, `file`



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
````{admonition} Where have we seen a YAML list?

You can create a community badge that uses as the location of the "contribution" a link to the snipped to a set of lines in your main spring2025 repo that is a YAML list.  This is valid as long as it is created by Friday 03/07. 
````


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The one last file tells us what dependencies we have

```bash
cat requirements.txt 
```
```
jupyter-book
matplotlib
numpy
```

If your book generates with error messages run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Notebooks with MyST Markdown

Jupyter Book also lets you write text-based notebooks using MyST Markdown.
See [the Notebooks with MyST Markdown documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/myst-notebooks.html) for more detailed instructions.
This page shows off a notebook written in MyST Markdown.

## An example cell

With MyST Markdown, you can define code cells with a directive like so:

\`\`\`{code-cell}
print(2 + 2)
\`\`\`

When your book is built, the contents of any `{code-cell}` blocks will be
executed with your default Jupyter kernel, and their outputs will be displayed
in-line with the rest of your content.

\`\`\`{seealso}
Jupyter Book uses [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert text-based files to notebooks, and can support [many other text-based notebook files](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/jupytext.html).
\`\`\`

## Create a notebook with MyST Markdown

MyST Markdown notebooks are defined by two things:

1. YAML metadata that is needed to understand if / how it should convert text files to notebooks (including information about the kernel needed).
   See the YAML at the top of this page for example.
2. The presence of `{code-cell}` directives, which will be executed with your book.

That's all that is needed to get started!

## Quickly add YAML metadata for MyST Notebooks

If you have a markdown file and you'd like to quickly add YAML metadata to it, so that Jupyter Book will treat it as a MyST Markdown Notebook, run the following command:

\`\`\`
jupyter-book myst init path/to/markdownfile.md
\`\`\`

```

cool, we can see that the content of that page is derived directly from this file


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


If you wanted to change the styling with sphinx you can use built in
[themes](https://sphinx-themes.org/) which tell sphinx to put different
files in the `_static` folder when it builds your site, but you don't have to change any of your content!  If you like working on front end things (which is great! it's just not alwasy the goal) you can even
build [your own theme](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/theming.html) that can work with sphinx.

## Starting a git repo locally

We made this folder, but we have not used any git operations on it yet, it is actually not a git repo, which we *could* tell from the output above, but let's use git to inspect and get another hint. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can try `git status`

```bash

git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

This tells us the `.git` directory is missing form the current path and all parent directories. 
This is because we simply created this folder `tiny-book` it's not linked to git whatsoever yet

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To make it a git repo we use `git init` with the path we want to initialize, which currently is `.`

```bash
git init .
```
```
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/ayman/Documents/systems/tiny-book/.git/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's see what changed

```bash
ls -a
```

```
./       _config.yml  markdown-notebooks.md  requirements.txt
../      _toc.yml     markdown.md
.git/    intro.md     notebooks.ipynb
_build/  logo.png     references.bib
```
we got a `.git/` folder



Let's check if we succeeded
```bash
git status
```
```

- [derived from a master/slave analogy](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html) which is not even how git works, but was adopted terminology from other projects
- [GitHub no longer does](https://github.com/github/renaming)
- [the broader community is changing as well](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/)
- [git allows you to make your default not be master](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.656.v4.git.1593009996.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)
- [literally the person who chose the names "master" and "origin" regrets that choice](https://twitter.com/xpasky/status/1271477451756056577) the name main is a more accurate and not harmful term and the current convention.

we'll change our default branch to main
```bash
git branch -m main
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and check in with git now
```bash
git status
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    _build/
	_config.yml
	_toc.yml
	intro.md
	logo.png
	markdown-notebooks.md
	markdown.md
	notebooks.ipynb
	references.bib
	requirements.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

this time it works and we see a two important things:
- there are no previous commits
- all of the files are untracked

## Handling Built files

The built site files are compeltey redundant, content wise, to the original markdown files. 

We do not want to keep track of changes for the built files since they are generated from the source files. It's redundant and makes it less clear where someone should update content. 


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

How can we tell it not to track the build folder?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Git helps us with this with the .gitignore

```bash
echo "_build" >> .gitignore
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main", "type":"output"}

```console
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore
    _config.yml
	_toc.yml
	intro.md
	logo.png
	markdown-notebooks.md
	markdown.md
	notebooks.ipynb
	references.bib
	requirements.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

only the `.gitingore` file  is listed! But it took away the `_build/` folder just as we want. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


and we will commit the template.
```
git add .
```
```

We have to add separately because the files are **untracked** we cannot use the `-a` option on commit

This is GitBash telling you that git is helping.  Windows uses two characters for a new line `CR` (cariage return) and `LF` (line feed).
Classic Mac Operating system used the `CR` character.  Unix-like systems (including MacOS X) use only the `LF` character. 
If you try to open a file on Windows that has only `LF` characters, Windows will think it's all one line. To help you, 
since git knows people collaborate across file systems, when you check out files from the git database (`.git/` directory)
git replaces `LF` characters with `CRLF` before updating your working directory. 

When working on Windows, when you make a file locally, each new line will have `CRLF` in it. If your collaborator
(or server, eg GitHub) runs not a unix or linux based operating system (it almost certainly does) these extra 
characters will make a mess and make the system interpret your code wrong. To help you out, 
git will automatically, for Windows users, convert `CRLF` to `LF` when it adds
your work to the index (staging area). Then when you push, it's the compatible version. 

[git documentation of the feature](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#Formatting-and-Whitespace) 
this is added to a [new Windows page under resources](../resources/windows.md)



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and then we will commit with a simple message

```bash

git commit -m 'jupyter book template'

## How do I push a repo that I made locally to GitHub?
Right now, we do not have any remotes, so if we try to push it will fail. Next we will see how to fix that. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

First let's confirm 
```bash

git push
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
fatal: No configured push destination.
Either specify the URL from the command-line or configure a remote repository using

    git remote add <name> <url>

and then push using the remote name

    git push <name>

```
and it tells us how to fix it.  This is why inspection is so powerful in 
developer tools, that is where we developers give one another hints. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Right now, we do not have any remotes

```bash
git remote
```
```

```



+++{"lesson_part": "main":"type":"redaction"}

For today, we will create an empty github repo shared with me, by accepting the assignment linked in prismia or ask a TA/instructor if you are making up class.

More generally, you can [create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)

That default page for an empty repo if you do not initiate it with any files will give you the instructions for what remote to add.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we add the remote

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/compsys-progools/tiny-book-aymanbx-1.git
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can see what it did

```bash
git remote
```
```
origin
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
git status
```
```
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Remember, It doesn't mention anything about whether we're ahead or behind with origin/main
That's because we haven't linked the two branches together yet.

```bash
git push
```
```
fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin main

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
```

git gives us advise on what to do

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
git push -u origin main
```
```
To https://github.com/compsys-progtools/tiny-book-AymanBx
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/compsys-progtools/tiny-book-AymanBx'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not
hint: have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to
hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote changes, use
hint: 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

This is telling us that there is a commit on the GitHub repo that doesn't exist locally so the two repos are out of sync. 

(We haven't made any changes ourselves on GitHub but when we create a repo on GitHub we get an `initial commit`)

```bash
git pull
```
```
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (5/5), 1.70 KiB | 102.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/compsys-progtools/tiny-book-AymanBx
 * [new branch]      feedback   -> origin/feedback
 * [new branch]      main       -> origin/main
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> main
```

This is telling us to that since the previous pull command didn't execute successfuly we still haven't linked the local main with the online main and we need to `git pull -u origin main`
