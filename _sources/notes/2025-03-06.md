# What *is* git? 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Last class we created a local repo, then created an empty repo on GitHub.
Linked both repos and attmpted to push local changes on the **"empty"** repo but weren't successful

The reason for that is the way the new GitHub repo was created. 
When we used GitHub Classroom to fork my template tiny-book repo as your new empty repo GitHub made two commits. 
Making it not an empty repo.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```bash
cd Documents/systems/tiny-book
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

```

When we attempted to `pull` we weren't fully successful because we failed to link the two mains because the `push` command failed.

There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We should follow git instructions
```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
```
```
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we should be able to pull successfully

Git recognized the different commit history as in the repos as a conflict

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
To resolve this type of conflict (main had unrelated changes on it that are unknown by my branch)
We `rebase`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
`rebase` is updating my current branch with new commits that occurred on main (or any branch I want to rebase with)
```bash
git pull --rebase
```
```
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/main.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
What did that do?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

A couple of weeks ago, we learned about what a commit is and then we took a break from how git works, to talk more about unix philosophy and how developers communicate about code

Today we will learn what git is more formally.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"} 

**study tip**

We will go in and out of topics at times, in order to provides what is called *spaced repetition*, repeating material or key concepts with breaks in between.  

Using git correctly is a really important goal of this course because git is an opportunity for you to demonstrate a wide range of both practical and conceptual understanding. 

So, I have elected to interleave other topics with git to give core git ideas some time to simmer and give you time to practice them before we build on them with more depth at git.  


Also, we are both learning git and *using* git as a motivating example of other key important topics. 

 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Why so much git? 

Today, we are going to learn *what* git is and later we will learn more details of how it is implemented.  

Remember we are spending so much time with git for two reasons: 
1. it is an important developer tool
2. it demonstrates important conceptual ideas that occur in other areas of CS


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

[git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the official reference on git.


this includes other spoken languages as well if that is helpful for you.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## git definition


From here, we have the full definition of git

[git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We do not start from that point, because these documents were written for target audience of working developers who are familar with other, old version control systems and learning an *additional* one. 


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"formative"}
Have you used another version control system before? 


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

Most of you, however, have probably not used another version control system. 



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

Let's break down the definition 

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git is a File system





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Content-addressable filesystem means a key-value data store.



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"formative"}

What are some examples of key-value pairs that you have seen in computer science broadly, and in this course specficially, so far? 




+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"solution"}


- python dictionaries
- pointers (address,content)
- parameter, passed values
- yaml files



+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"solution"}

some examples of key-value pairs that you have seen in computer science broadly, and in this course specficially

- python dictionaries
- pointers (address,content)
- parameter, passed values
- yaml files





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

What this means is that you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will hand you back a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content.




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git is a Version Control System




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

In the before times

![PhD comics final.doc comic](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

git stores **snapshots** of your work each time you commit.


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"formative"}

What unit of git is how it represents a snapshot?

- [ ] branch
- [ ] blob
- [x] commit
- [ ] tag


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

![snapshot of 5 versions of 3 files](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/snapshots.png)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

it uses 3 stages:


![3 stages in git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/areas.png)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

These three stages are the in relation to your working directory, and potentially remotes.  

So in broader context, the [git visual cheatsheet](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index;) is a more complete picture and has commands overlayed with the concept. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}



## Git has two sets of commands

- Porcelain: the user friendly VCS
- Plumbing: the internal workings- a toolkit for a VCS


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"formative"}


Which of the following commands are porcelain commands? 

```
git commit
git cat-file
git add
git status
git hash-object
```

+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"formative"}


Which of the following commands are porcelain commands? 

```
git commit
git cat-file
git add
git status
git hash-object
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We have so far used git as a version control system.  A version control system, in general, will have operations like commit, push, pull, clone.  These may work differently under the hood or be called different things, but those are what something needs to have in order to keep track of different versions.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The plumbing commands reveal the *way* that git performs version control operations.  This means, they implement the git file system operations for the git version control system.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

You can think of the plumbing vs porcelain commands like public/private methods.  As a user, you only need the public methods (porcelain commands) but those use the private ones to get things done (plumbing commands).  We will use the plumbing commands over the next few classes to examine what git *really* does when we call the porcelain commands that we will typically use.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Example? 


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git is distributed





+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

What does that mean?  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Git runs locally.  It can run in many places, and has commands to help sync across remotes, but git does not require one copy of the repository to be the "official" copy and the others to be subordinate.  git just sees repositories.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For human reasons, we like to have one "official" copy and treat the others as other copies, but that is a social choice, not a technological requirement of git. Even though we will typically use it with an offical copy and other copies, having a tool that does not care, makes the tool more flexible and allows us to create workflows, or networks of copies that have any relationship we want.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


It's about the workflows, or the ways we socially *use* the tool.




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Subversion  Workflow


![subversion workflow](https://git-scm.com/images/about/workflow-a@2x.png)

subversion is an older VCS


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Centralized Manager


![integration manager workflow](https://git-scm.com/images/about/workflow-b@2x.png)



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### dictator and lieutenants
![dictator and lieutenants workflow](https://git-scm.com/images/about/workflow-c@2x.png)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is a variant of a multiple-repository workflow. It’s generally used by huge projects with hundreds of collaborators; one famous example is the Linux kernel. Various integration managers are in charge of certain parts of the repository; they’re called lieutenants. All the lieutenants have one integration manager known as the benevolent dictator. The benevolent dictator pushes from their directory to a reference repository from which all the collaborators need to pull.


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## How does git do all these things?



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can use the bash command `find` to search the file *system*. Note that this does not search the contents of the files, just the names.


```bash
find objects/ -type f
```
```
.git/objects/06/d56f40c838b64eb048a63e036125964a069a3a

.git/objects/fd/b7176c429a73d5335e127b27d530b8aaa07c7d
```

We searched for anything of the type `file` with the option `-type f`


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



This is a lot of files! It's more than we have in our working directory. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see that by looking at the working directory with `ls`

```bash
ls
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
_build/      _toc.yml  logo.png               markdown.md      references.bib
_config.yml  intro.md  markdown-notebooks.md  notebooks.ipynb  requirements.txt
```
And remember, `_build` is not being tracked. That means git knows nothing about it or about its content


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is a consequence of git taking snap shots and tracking both the actual contents of our working directory **and** our commit messages and other meta data about each commit. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git Variables



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


the program `git` does not run continously the entire time you are using it for a project.  It runs quick commands each time you tell it to, it's goal is to manage files, so this makes sense.  This also means that important information that `git` needs is also saved in files.  




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see the files that it has by listing the directory: 

```bash
ls .git
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
COMMIT_EDITMSG  HEAD    description  index  logs/     refs/
FETCH_HEAD      config  hooks/       info/  objects/
```

the files in all caps are like gits variables.  




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Lets look at the one called `HEAD` we have interacted with `HEAD` before when resolving merge conflicts.

```bash
cat .git/HEAD 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
ref: refs/heads/main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

`HEAD` is a pointer to the currently checked out branch. Do you remember where we see this pointer?

The other files with `HEAD` in their name are similarly pointers to other references, named corresponding to other things. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}



## Git Objects

There are 3 types:
- blob objects: the content of your files (data)
- tree objects: stores file names and groups files together (organization)
- Commit Objects: stores information about the sha values of the snapshots




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

[mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/e)



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

    class tree{

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
What branch are we on at the moment? 
We can tell from `git status` or from what we saw on `git log`
But all these commands are really getting their info from the HEAD pointer, and we now know how to do so our selves:
```bash 
cat .git/HEAD
```
```
ref: refs/heads/organization
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's try to trace what we can find in that file
```bash
cat .git/refs/heads/organization
```
```
99c73d4f2c0c87c3aef7a61366e56e3894a040a5
```

We see a hash (made of 32 characters)
A hash in git can be a representation of multiple things. 
One of its uses is that it is used as a names of git objects that hold the different information of a git repository.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's confirm that we can find that file
```bash 
ls .git/objects/
```
```
0f/  23/  39/  4e/  56/  76/  83/  99/  a6/  ce/  e4/
16/  2d/  3a/  4f/  58/  7b/  8b/  9d/  a9/  d7/  f9/
1e/  33/  3c/  50/  63/  7f/  92/  9e/  ab/  d8/  info/
1f/  35/  4c/  54/  65/  80/  93/  a2/  b0/  e0/  pack/
```
The first two characters of the hash can be found here as a directory `99/`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
If we look at the contents of that folder 
```bash
ls .git/objects/99
```
```
42c3c00dcde51d52a1c110413522043eca07cd
c73d4f2c0c87c3aef7a61366e56e3894a040a5
```
We see two files, one of them is `c73d4f2c0c87c3aef7a61366e56e3894a040a5` which is the remainder of that hash

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Can we read what's in that file?
```bash
cat .git/objects/99/c73d4f2c0c87c3aef7a61366e56e3894a040a5
```
```

```
Not very readable. But We've talked about how this is supposed to represent a status of the repository. It is supposed to represent a commit. We can confirm that by looking at the `git log` from earlier. The very first commit was represented by that same hash!

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's see if there's another way to view the content of that file
```bash 
git cat-file -t 99c73
```
```
commit
```
That's the type `-t`!
```bash 
git cat-file -p 99c73
```
```

```
We see that the contetns is detailed information about the last commit, we see some of this in the log. But here we find all the information.
We had to use `git cat-file` specifically to view the content, because if we view it in its raw shape we get a bunch of weird characters. That's because git compressed this information in binary to save disk space. Making the way git saves its information more space efficient.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Cool! 
Let's try one more thing. How can I find how the contents of a file is saved by git.
Lets try to find a `blob` object. 
Let's check out the other file that was in the `99/` directory
```bash
git cat-file -t 9942c
```
```
commit
```
Ok, we found another commit. Let's view it

Update about.md
```
Looks like we updated the about.md file in this commit. Let's keep tracing. This commit is made of the tree `a2ea9badc19dc1d94af5957a8f6f128a3b316f49`. Let's check it out
```bash
git cat-file -p a2ea9
```
```

```
Cool, we found that blob that represents the about.md at that particular commit. 
Let's keep digging
```bash
git cat-file -t 920e4

Yeah, that's write, we had added another fun fact that time we got a merge conflict. 

So that confirms it. We were just able to find an old version of about.md from an old commit.
This is how git stores all the information that tracks all the changes that occurred. 

One final thing, what happens if we try to view the contents of that hash without using `git cat-file`?
```bash
cat .git/objects/92/0e41a47826309b0bca92645e1ce0c734830ed0

Same as earlier, we just get a bunch of weird characters because of how git compresses the information into a binary.
