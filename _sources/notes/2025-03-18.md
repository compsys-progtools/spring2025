# How does git make a commit?


## Important
If you missed a class and want to make up for the experience badge, you must complete the tasks found in "Experience Report Evidence" if found at the end of the notes 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Today we will dig into how git really works.  This will be a deep dive and provide a lot of details about how git creates a commit.  It will reinforce important **concepts**, which is of practical use when fixing things give you some ideas about how you might fix things when things go wrong.  




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Later, we will build on this more on the practical side, but these **concepts** are very important for making sense of the more practical aspects of fixing things in git.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


This deep dive in git is to help you build a correct, flexbile understanding of git so that you can use it independently and efficiently. The plumbing commands do not need to be a part of your daily use of git, but they are the way that we can dig in and see what *actually* happens when git creates a commit. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
 
 **this is also to serve as an example method you could apply in understanding another complex system**

Inspecting a system's components is a really good way to understand it and correctly understanding it will impact your ability to ask good questions and even look up the right thing to do when you need to fix things. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Also, looking at the parts of git is a good way to reinforce specific design patterns that are common in CS in a practical way.  This means that today we will also: 
- review and practice with the bash commands we have seen so far
- see a practical example of hashing
- reinforce through examples what a pointer does



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

navigate to your github inclass repo

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Recall: git stores important content in *files* that it uses like variables. 


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}


What is one example of a file in git that works like a pointer? 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For example:
```
cat .git/HEAD 
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main", "type":"solution"}

```
ref: refs/heads/organization
```
holds the current branch that git will compare the working directory with.

What do we find inside that file?
```bash
cat .git/refs/heads/organization
```
```
99c73d4f2c0c87c3aef7a61366e56e3894a040a5
```
We find a hash. If you remember this hash is a commit. We can confirm that by looking at the `git log`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```bash
cat .git/config 
```
```
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = false
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
        symlinks = false
        ignorecase = true
[remote "origin"]
        url = https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-AymanBx
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "main"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/main
[branch "1-create-an-about-file"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/1-create-an-about-file
[branch "organization"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/organization
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
stores information about the different branches and remotes. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

There are many: 

```
ls .git
```
```
COMMIT_EDITMSG  ORIG_HEAD    hooks/  logs/        refs/
FETCH_HEAD      config       index   objects/
HEAD            description  info/   packed-refs
```

+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}

What file stores information for git and lives outside of the .git directory? 

- [x] .gitignore
- [ ] HEAD
- [ ] config
- [ ] ORIG_HEAD


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


`.gitignore` is a file in the working direcotry that contains a list of files and patterns to not track. 
We keep it in the working directory because we want it to be tracked by git like other files. So it can be pushed to GitHub also so files that are meant to be ignored can be ignored on all local copies of the repo




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see it is a hidden file in the working directory with `ls -a`
```bash
ls -a
```
```
./          CONTRIBUTING.md         helper_functions.py
../         LICENSE.md              important_classes.py
.git/       README.md               my_secrets/
.github/    about.md                philosophy.md
.gitignore  abstract_base_class.py  scratch.ipynb
.secrets    alternative_classes.py  setup.py
API.md      docs/                   tests/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and what it contains: 

```bash
cat .gitignore
```
```
.secrets
my_secrets/*
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Creating a repo from scratch


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will start in the top level course directory.

```bash

cd ..
ls
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}


```
gh-inclass-AymanBx/  prep/  spring25-kwl-AymanBx/  tiny-book/
```

Yours should also have your kwl repo, gh inclass repo, course website clone, etc.  



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

We can create an empty repo from scratch using `git init <path>`

Last time we used an existing directory like `git init .` because we were working in the directory that already existed

+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}
We can create an empty repo from scratch using `git init <path>`

Last time we used an existing directory like `git init .`, what does that mean about our path when we used the command? 

- [ ] we had made a shortcut to the content we want to use for the repo already at `.`
- [x] the folder we wanted to use as the repo was th currnt working directory
- [ ] we wanted to make the repo name interactively after running the command

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Today we will create a new directory called `test` and initialize it as a repo at the same time:

```
git init test
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

[we get this message again, see context from last week](https://introcompsys.github.io/fall2023/notes/2023-09-28.html#retiring-racist-language)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can see what it did by first looking at the working directory


```bash

ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","output"}

```
gh-inclass-AymanBx/  prep/  spring25-kwl-AymanBx/  
test/  tiny-book/ 
```

it made a new folder named as we said


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and we can go into that directory

```bash

cd test/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and then rename the branch
```bash

git branch -m main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To clarify we will look at the status

```bash
git status
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}


Notice that there are no commits, and no origin. 


```
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```bash
ls .git
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
HEAD		description	info		refs
config		hooks		objects
```

we can see the basic requirements of an empty repo here.  

+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

What does this tell us about the other files we saw in the gh inclass .git directory? 

+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}
Additional variables that are created along the use of the repo


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

What command lets us search the file system, meaning the names of files for matches to a pattern? 

- [ ] search
- [ ] grep
- [ ] awk
- [x] find
- [ ] wc
- [ ] fsearch

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Searching the file system


We can use the bash command `find` to search the file *system* note that this does not search the **contents** of the files, just the names.


```
find .git/objects/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
.git/objects/
.git/objects//pack
.git/objects//info
```




we have a few items in that directory and the directory itself.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can limit by type, to only files with the `-type` option set to `f`


```
find .git/objects/ -type f
```
```

```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

And we have no results. We have no objects yet. Because this is an empty repo 



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}


Which of the following is not a type of git `object`? 

- [ ] commit
- [x] branch
- [ ] tree
- [ ] blob




+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
## Git Objects

Remember our 3 types of objects
- blob objects: the content of your files (data)
- tree objects: stores file names and groups files together (organization)
- Commit Objects: stores information about the sha values of the snapshots



```{mermaid}

classDiagram
    class tree{
    List: 
      - hash: blob
      - string: type
      - string:file name 
    }
    class commit{
        hash: parent
        hash: tree
        string: message
        string: author 
        string: time
    }
    class blob{
        binary: contents
    }
    class object{
        hash: name

    }
    object <|-- blob
    object <|-- tree
    object <|-- commit
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### How to create an object



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

All git objects are files stored with the name that is the hash of the content in the file




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Remember git is a content-addressable file systsem... so it uses key- value pairs. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Let's create our first git object.  git uses hashes as the key. We give the hashing function some content, it applies the algorithm and returns us the hash as the reference to that object.  We can also write to our .git directory  with  this.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The `git hash-object` command works on files, but we do not have any files yet.  We can create a file, but we do not have to.  Remememer, **everything** is a file. 


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}

What file do we always have access to to use for temporary use? 

- [ ] tmp.md
- [x] stdout
- [ ] terminal
- [ ] temporary 

+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}

What bash commmand sends its input to stdout? 

- [ ] print
- [ ] show
- [x] echo
- [ ] tmpstore
- [ ] stdstore


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### Note
As a fun exercise, for the remainder of the class try to follow along with exactly the same text that I use in commands. Same capitalization and spacing. 
It isn't a big deal if you didn't


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

When we use things like `echo` it writes to the stdout file. 

```bash

echo "test content"
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main", "type":"output"}

```
test content
```
which shows on our terminal.



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}

What allows us to chain commands together using output from one as input to the next? 

- [ ] a link (&)
- [ ] a redirect (>>)
- [x] a pipe (|)

+++{"lesson_part": "main",}
We can us a pipe to connect the stdout of on command to the stdin of the next. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Pipes are an important part of computer sience too. we're seeing them in context of real uses, and we will keep seeing them. Pipes can connect the std out of one command to the std in of the next.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```bash
echo "test content" | git hash-object --stdin
```




We can break down this command: 
- git hash-object would take the content you handed to it and merely return the unique key
- `--stdin` option tells git hash-object to get the content to be processed from stdin instead of a file
- the `|` is called a pipe (what we saw before was a redirect) it pipes a _process_ output into the next command
- `echo` would write to stdout, withthe pip it passes that to std in of the `git-hash`



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we get back the hash:

```
d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
```

Notice how we all got the same hash. This is because the hash is generated by a hashing algorithm that uses the content we provided to generate the hash

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's check if it wrote to the directory.
```bash
find .git/objects/ -type f
```
```

```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now let's run it again with a slight modification. `-w` option tells the command to also write that object to the database

```bash
echo "test content" | git hash-object -w --stdin
```
```
d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and we can check if it wrote to the directory.
```bash
find .git/objects/ -type f
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main","output":"type"}
```
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
```


and we see a file that it was supposed to have!




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
### Viewing git objects 

We can try with `cat`
```bash

cat .git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4 
```
Notice that the first two characters from the hash were used as a folder name


+++{"lesson_part": "main","output":"type"}



```
xK??OR04f(I-.QH??+I?+?K?	
```

This is binary output that we cannot understand.  Fortunately, git provides a utility. We can use `cat-file` to use the object by referencing at least 4 characters that are unique from the full hash, not the file name. (`7046` will not work, but `d670` will). Because the hash starts with at the name of the folder 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



`cat-file` requires *an* option `-t` is for type


```bash

git cat-file -t d670
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
blob
```

we see that it is a blob. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Then we can do it with the `-p` option for pretty print instead to see the content

```bash

git cat-file -p d670
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
test content
```

where we see the content we put in to the hashing function



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is the content that we put in, as expected. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Hashing a file



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}

What allows us to send the outputs of a command to a different file instead of stdout? 

- [ ] a link (&)
- [x] a redirect (>>)
- [ ] a pipe (|)




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


let's create a file. 

```bash

echo "version 1" >test.txt
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and store it,  by hashing it


```bash

git hash-object -w test.txt 
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we can look at what we have.

```bash

find .git/objects/ -type f
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

we see two objects as expected

```
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

Now this is the status of our repo. 
```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class d67046{
        + "test content"
        +(blob)
    }
    class 83baae{
       + version 1
       + (blob)
    }
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can check the type of files with `git cat-file` and `-t`

```bash

git cat-file -t 83baa
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



``` bash
git cat-file -t d670
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
blob
```
it is a blob object as expected



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Notice, however, that we only have one file in the working directory. 


```bash

ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
test.txt
```

it is the one test.txt, the first blob we made had no file in the working directory associated to it. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


the workign directory and the git repo are not strictly the same thing, and can be different like this.  Mostly they will stay in a closer relationship that we currently have unless we use plumbling commands, but this is good to build a solid understanding of how the `.git` directory relates to your working directory.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```
git status
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	test.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```


So far, even though we have hashed the object, git still thinks the file is untracked, because it is not in a tree and there are no commits that point to that part of the tree.



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}

When working with porcelain commands, what do we do before we can make a commit? 

- [ ] hash the content
- [ ] push to remote
- [x] stage the content (put it in the index)

+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}

What porcelain command puts content in the index? 

- [ ] commit
- [ ] stash
- [x] add
- [ ] pull



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
This is still what our repo looks like

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class d67046{
        +"test content"
        +(blob)
    }
    class 83baae{
       +version 1
       +(blob)
    }
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Updating the Index

Now, we can add our file as it is to the index. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



```bash
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \
 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30 test.txt
```

the `\` lets us wrap onto a second line.

- this the plumbing command `git update-index` updates or in this case creates an index which is the staging area of our repository
- the `--add` option is because the file doesn’t yet exist in our staging area (we don’t even have a staging area set up yet)
- `--cacheinfo` because the file we're adding isn’t in your directory but is in the database.
- in this case, we’re specifying a mode of 100644, which means it’s a normal file.
- then the hash object we want to add to the index (the content) in our case, we want the hash of the first version of the file, not the most recent one.
- finally the file name of that content

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Again, we check in with status

```bash

git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

```

We have the files staged as expected

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now the file is staged. 

Let's edit it further. 

```bash

echo "version 2" >> test.txt
```
Remember `>>` allows us to append

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can look at the content to ensure it as expected

```bash

cat test.txt 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
version 1
version 2
```

So the file has two lines


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now check status again. 

```bash

git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```


We added the first version of the file to the staging area, so that version is ready to commit  but we have changed the version in our working directory relative to the version from the hash object that we put in the staging area so we *also* have changes not staged.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can hash and store this version too. 


```bash

git hash-object -w test.txt
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
0c1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can then look again at our list of objects. 

```bash

find .git/objects/ -type f
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
.git/objects//0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

So now our repo has 3 items, all blobs:


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class d67046{
        +"test content"
        +(blob)
    }
    class 83baae{
       +version 1
       +(blob)
    }
    class 0c1e73{
        +version 1
        +version 2
        +(blob)
    }
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
git status
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

hashing the object does not impact the index, which is what git status uses


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Preparing to Commit

When we work with porcelain commands, we use add then commit.  We have staged the file, which we know is  what happens when we add.  What else has to happen to make a commit.  

We know that commits are comprised of:
- a message
- author and times stamp info
- a pointer to a tree
- a pointer to the parent (except the first commit)

We do not have any of these items yet.  

Let's make a tree next. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now we can write a tree from the index,

```bash

git write-tree
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
```

and we get a hash

Notice how we didn't have to pass any arguments to that command. It uses what is in the index to build the tree

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Lets examine the tree, first check the type

```bash

git cat-file -t d832
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
tree
```

it is as expected

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and now we can look at its contents

```bash

git cat-file -p d832
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
100644 blob 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30	test.txt
```


Let's look at the objects now
```bash

find .git/objects/ -type f
```
```
.git/objects/0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects/83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
.git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects/d8/329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
```



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}


Now this is the status of our repo:

Again, we will check in with git via `git status`

```bash

git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}


```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

Nothing has changed, making the tree does not yet make the commit



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



This only keeps track of the objects, there are also still the HEAD that we have not dealt with and the index. 

```bash
cat .git/HEAD
```
```
ref: refs/heads/main
```
```bash
ls .git/refs/heads/
```
heads folder is still empty. That's an inducator that as far as git knows. No commits to any branch have been made yet.

### Creating a commit manually

We can echo a commit message through a pipe into the commit-tree plumbing function to commit a particular hashed object.
```bash
echo "first commit"
```
```
first commit
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

the `git commit-tree` command requires a message via  stdin and the tree hash.  We will use stdin and a pipe for the message

```bash

echo "first commit" | git commit-tree d832
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}


```
62467cd0c316a93201e98685a9d9f9beed8e6e27
```



and we get back a hash. But notice that this hash is unique for each of us. Because the commit has information about the time stamp and our user.  

Now we check the final list of objects that we have for today
```bash

find .git/objects/ -type f
```
```
.git/objects/0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547

## What does git status do? 

_compares the working directory to the current state of the active branch_


- we can see the working directory with: `ls`
- we can see the active branch in the `HEAD` file 
- what is its status? 





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



```bash 
git status
```
```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   test.txt

```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



we see it is "on main" this is because we set the branch to main , but since we have not added the commit to main git still doesn't know we made a commit. Notice that when we use the porcelain command for commit, it does this automatically; the porcelain commands do many things.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Notice, git says we have no commits yet even though we have written a commit. 

In our case because we made the commit manually, we did not update the branch. 

 This is because the main branch does not *point* to any commit.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



We can verify by looking at the `HEAD` file

```
cat .git/HEAD
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
ref: refs/heads/main
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


and then viewing that file
```
cat .git/refs/heads/main
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
cat: .git/refs/heads/main: No such file or directory
```
which does not even exist!



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
ls .git/refs/heads
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


nothing exists there yet!




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
But we can see the `heads` folder exists

```
ls .git/refs
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
heads	tags
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


we can see the objects though: 

```bash
find .git/objects/ -type f
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



```bash
git cat-file -t 62467
```

```
commit
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



```bash
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

This is because git status works off the HEAD file and we have not updated that or set our branch to point to our commit yet. 





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git References





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can make that file manually

```
echo 188a75ef66b6a85be0ab68d8575ec27808881dfc > .git/refs/heads/main
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
git status
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see that indeed we have one object that is a commit




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
git cat-file -p 62467
```

```
tree d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
author AymanBx <ayman_sandouk@uri.edu> 1741922840 -0400
committer AymanBx <ayman_sandouk@uri.edu> 1741922840 -0400

first commit
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
git cat-file -p d8329
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
100644 blob 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30	test.txt
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



```
git cat-file -p 83baa
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So we now have HEAD-> main and main -> our commit -> tree --> blob.
