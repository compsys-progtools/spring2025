# Working offline

Today more clear motivation for each thing we do and more context.

---

Today we will learn to work with GitHub offline, this requires understanding some about file systems and how content is organized on computers. 

We will learn:
- relative and absolute paths
- basic bash commands for navigating the file system
- authenticating to GitHub on a terminal
- how to clone a repo
- how fetch and checkout work

---

## Let's get organized

---

For class you should have a folder on your computer where you will keep all of your materials.

---

We will start using the terminal today, by getting all set up.

---

Open a terminal window.  I am going to use `bash` commands

- if you are on mac, your default shell is `zsh` which is mostly the same as bash for casual use. you can switch to bash to make your output more like mine using the command `bash` if you want, but it is not required. 
- if you are on windows, your **GitBash** terminal will be the least setup work to use `bash` (preferred)
- if you have WSL (if you do not, no need to worry) you should be able to set your linux shell to `bash` (I believe it already is set to bash)

---

If you use `pwd` you can see your current path



```

```nt path



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

---

```
 console

```Users/ayman
```

It outputs the absolute path of the location that I was at.

---

we start at home (~)

---

We can **c**hange **d**irectory with `cd`

---

if we use `cd` without a path, it goes back to home `cd ~` would do the same

---

We can **m**a**k** a new **dir**ectory with `mkdir`

---

What you want to have is a folder for class (mine is systems) in a place you can find it

You might:
- make a systems folder in your Documents folder
- make an inclass folder in the CSC311 folder you already made
- use the CSC311 folder as your in class working space

---

If I run the following commands, what do I expect as the output?

```
cd 
pwd
```

- [ ] cannot tell, do not know where you started
- [x] /c/Users/ayman
- [ ] /c/Users/ayman/Documents
- [ ] the same as whereever you were before

---

When you use `pwd` what type of path does it return?

- [x] absolute
- [ ] relative

---

The first slash (/) represents the /(root) directory, which is the starting place for the search

---

But what does it mean when a path starts with `.` or `..`?

---

To go back one step in the path, (one level up in the tree) we use `cd ..` 

```

```el up in the tree) we use `cd ..` 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ..
```

---

`..` is a special file that points to a specific relative path, of one level up. (In other words, parent folder/directory)

use `pwd` , `cd` and `pwd` to illustrate what "one level up" means

---

Did you notice the dieffernce?

send the lines you would run + a description of what is important in the output

---

```
cds Documents/
```

---

```
bash: cds: command not found
```
notice that command not found is the error when there is a typo

---

```
cd Documents/
pwd
```

---

```
/c/Users/ayman/Documents
```

---

```
mkdir systems
```

---

``` cd systems```
``` pwd ```

---

```
/c/Users/ayman/Documents/systems
```

---

```
cd ..
pwd
```

```
/c/Users/ayman/Documents/
```

---

If we give no path to `cd` it brings us to home. 
```
cd 
pwd
```

---

```
/c/Users/ayman
```

---

Then we can go back. 

```
cd Documents/systems/
pwd
```

---

```
/c/Users/ayman/Documents/systems
```

---

Do you have any content in the folder?

---

```
ls
```

---

Could be empty of if you had created it before you would see the content you had in it

---

We can use two levels up at once like this: 

```
cd ../../
pwd
```

---

```
/c/Users/ayman
```

---

```
cd Documents/systems/
```

---

What character is always at the start of absolute paths? 


- [ ] :
- [x] /
- [ ] *
- [ ] ]

---

What type of path is `../../Downloads` ?

- [ ] absolute
- [x] relative


## A toy repo for in class



**this repo will be for *in class* work, you will not get feedback inside of it, unless you ask, but you will answer questions in your kwl repo about what we do in this repo sometimes** 

**only work in this repo during class time** or making up class, unless specifically instructed to

---

Preferred: 

1. [view the template](https://github.com/compsys-progtools/template-gh-inclass)
1. click the green "use this template" button in the top right
2. make `compsys-progtools` the owner
3. set the name to `gh-inclass-<your gh username>` replacing the `<>` part with your actual name

---

Backup: [accept the assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/4aWlkmar)

## Authenticating with GitHub 


We have two choices to Download a repository:
1. clone to maintain a link using git
1. download zip to not have to use git, but have no link

we want option 1 beacuse we are learning git

---

For a public repo, it won't matter, you can use any way to download it that you wuold like, but for a private repo, we need to be authenticated.  


### Authenticating with GitHub

---

There are many ways to authenticate securely with GitHub and other git clients.  We're going to use *easier* ones for today, but we'll come back to the third, which is a bit more secure and is a more general type of authentication.

---

1. ssh keys (we will do this later)
1. `gh` CLI with ```gh auth login```

---

we will do opiton 2 for today

---

#### GitBash (windows mostly)

- `git clone` and paste your URL from GitHub
- then follow the prompts, choosing to authenticate in Browser. 

#### Native terminal ( MacOS X/Linux/WSL)

- GitHub CLI: enter `gh auth login` and follow the prompts.
- then `git clone` and paste your URL from github
 
#### If nothing else works
Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). This is a special one time password that you can use like a password, but it is limited in scope and will expire (as long as you choose settings well). 

Then proceed to the clone step. You may need to configure an identity later with [`git config`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

**also go to office hours later to get better authentication**

---

### Cloning a repository

We will create a local copy by cloning

```
git clone https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-AymanBx
```

---

```
Cloning into 'gh-inclass-AymanBx`...
remote: Enumerating objects: 8, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 8 (delta 0), reused 4 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (8/8), done.
```

---

Confirm it worked with: 
```
ls
```

---

```
gh-inclass-AymanBx
```
We see the new folder that matches our repo name

---

## What is in a repo?

---

We can enter that folder
```
cd gh-inclass-AymanBx/
```

---

When we compare the local directory to GitHub

```
ls
```

---

Notice that the `.github/workflows` that we see on GitHub is missing,
that is because it is *hidden*.  All file names that start with `.` are hidden.

---

We can actually see the rest with the `-a` for **all** *option* or *flag*.  Options are how we can pass non required parameters to command line programs. 

```
ls -a
```

---

```
.		.git		
..		.github
```

---

We also see some special "files", `.` the current location and `..` up one directory

---

We can the `tab` to complete once we have a unique set of characters. If what we have is not unique bash will do nothing when you press tab once, but if you press it multiple tiems it will show you the options:

---

`ls` can also take an explicit path as the argument to list a different folder than the current working directory. 

```

```ment to list a different folder than the current working directory. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .github/
```

---

## How do I know what git knows? 

[`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) is your friend.

---

```
git status
```

---

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

this command compares your working directory (what you can see with `ls -a` and all subfolders except the `.git` directorty) to the current state of your `.git` directory.

---

## Making a branch with GitHub and working offline

First on an issue, create a branch using the link in the development section of the right side panel. See the [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) for how to do that.

---

"create an about file"

---

Then it gives you two steps to do. We are going to do them one at a time so we can see better what they each do.

---

First we will update the `.git` directory without changing the working directory using [git fetch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch). We have to tell git fetch where to get the data from, we do that using a name of a {term}`remote`.

---



---

```
git fetch origin
```

---

```
From https://github.com/introcompsys/gh-inclass-AymanBx
 * [new branch]      1-create-an-about-file -> origin/1-create-an-about-file
```

---

We can look at the repo to see what has changed. 

```
git status
```

---

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
This says nothing, because remember git status tells us the relationship between our working directory and the .git repo.

---

Next, we switch to that branch. 

```
git checkout 1-create-an-about-file
```

---

```
branch '1-create-an-about-file' set up to track 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.
Switched to a new branch '1-create-an-about-file'
```

---

and verify what happened



```
git status
```

---

```
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

## Creating a file on the terminal

The `touch` command creates an empty file. 
```
touch about.md
```

---

We can use `ls` to see our working directory now.

---

```bash
ls
```

---

```
about.md
```

---

## Why do we need this for computer systems?

---

### Computer Systems are designed by people

---

Computer Science is not a natural science like biology or physics where we try
to understand some aspect of the world that we live in.  Computer Science as a
discipline, like algorithms, mostly derives from Math.

---

So, when we study computer science, while parts of it are limited by physics, most of it is essentially an
imaginary world that is made by people.  Understanding how people think, both
generally, and common patterns within the community of programmers
understand how things work and why they are the way they are.  The why can also
make it easier to remember, or, it can help you know what things you can find
alternatives for, or even where you might invent a whole new thing that is
better in some way.

---

Of course, not *all* programmers think the same way, but when
people spend time together and communicate, they start to share patterns in how
they think. So, while you do **not** have to think the same way as these patterns,
knowing what they are will help you reading code, and understanding things.

---

### Context Matters



This context of how things were developed can influence how we understand it.
We will also talk about the history of computing as we go through different
topics in class so that we can build that context up.

---

### Optimal is relative

The "best" way to do something is always relative to the context.  "Best" is a
vague term.  It could be most computationally efficient theoretically,
fastest to run on a particular type of hardware, or easiest for another programmer
to read.
