## Absolute Path vs Relative Path


Navigate to your inclass repo on your terminal


```
pwd
```


```
/c/Users/ayman
```

---

Which command will help me navigate between folders?
- [ ] ls
- [x] cd 
- [ ] pwd
- [ ] mkdir


```{Note}
Remember: cd stands for **c**hange **d**irectory
```
---

What type of path do I use with the command `cd`?
- [ ] absolute path only
- [ ] relative path only
- [x] Either one will work

---

Using absolute path means you know how to navigate to your desired folder starting from the root `/`

---

The `/` is the starting point to where all your files and folders can be found

---

Using you **relative** path, means that you know how to reach your desired folder relative to where you are right now


How do I get to Tyler 052?


Absolute path: USA/Rhode Island/Kingston/Flag rd/Green house rd/Red building/052
Relative path: leave Ranger 302 (..)/ leave Ranger Hall (..)/ Through quad/ pass by engineering/ Red building/ 052

---


The `/` between folder names means "from here, go to" 
We can separate the `cd` command that contains `/` into multiple commands

---

``` 
cd Documents/ 
cd systems/
```

---

```
pwd
```


```
/c/Users/ayman/Documents/systems
```

---

Let's try another way

```
cd ../../
pwd
```


```
/c/Users/ayman
```

---

```
cd Documents/systems/
```


```
pwd
```


```
/c/Users/ayman/Documents/systems
```

---

We got to the same destination

---

Watch your steps carefully for this one (Don't hit `Enter`)
``` 
cd gh-
```
Hit `Tab`
``` 
cd gh-inclass-AymanBx
```
Now you can hit `Enter`

---

```{Note} 
The terminal determined that the existing folders/files that begin with "gh-" are limited to only one and helped you complete it with the press of `tab`
```
---

**getting to GitHub from your local system**

---

Now on the other side of things, navigate to your inclass repo on GitHub

the step below requires that you have the `gh` CLI. 


``` 
gh repo view --web
```



What files/folders can you see on there?

```
.github/workflows
```
---

How many branches do you have?

```
main
1-create-an-about-file
```
---

Select the 1-create-an-about-file


Same files so far (No changes made yet)

---

Back to your terminal

---

Let's go back to comparing files between online and local repos


```
ls -a
```


```{Note}
We used `-a` as an option for showing us hidden files/folders (anything that starts with a `.`)
```


```
.          .git
..         .github
```


We'll notice a few things here


We have three extra files/folders



We know what `..` refers to by now. It's a pointer to the parent direcctory


The `.` is a pointer to where I am right now (the current directory)


---

Let's test out this theory
``` 
pwd
```


```
/c/Users/ayman/Documents/systems/gh-inclass-AymanBx
```



```
cd .
pwd
```

```
/c/Users/ayman/Documents/systems/gh-inclass-AymanBx
```


Our place didn't change. It checks out!

---

## .git

The third difference was the `.git` folder

---

`.git` folder is created by the `git` tool that we use on our terminal to hold special information about the project we're working on

---

Everytime we start a command with the word `git` we're calling that tool and then telling it what we want it to do

---

So far we saw `**git** status` and `**git** fetch`

---

`status` & `fetch` were the commands that we asked git to execute


```
.git is a black box ( until furhter notice ;-) )
It holds tracking information about what changes were made locally and online
```
---

We use `git fetch` to update the .git box with changes that happed on the GitHub repo

---

Let's try it
``` 
git fetch
```

---

If you got nothing then your .git box is already up to date with the online **repo** (project)

---

Check the current status of your project
```
git status
```

---

```
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

`git status` is your friend, we will use it all the time to keep track of our movements

---

Notice two key lines here

---

`Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.` is telling you that your local project matches the online one at the moment (as far as it knows)

---

More importantly, `nothing to commit, working tree clean` is telling you that your local repo (everything out side of the .git folder) matches the tracking information of git (everything inside the .git folder)

---

**Much** more on that later

---

Lastly, one more small thing we noticed

---

Github showed us `.github/workflows` whereas `ls -a` only showed my `.github`


As discussed, the `/` tells us that this there is a file/folder within a folder


Github combined them in one because there are no other files/folders on the .github folder


How do we prove it?


``` 
ls .github
```


```
workflows/
```


Listing the contents of .github showed us that it contains the folder "workflows" with it

---
```{Note}
Conclusion: The `ls` command can take an **argument** that is a path and it will list the contents of the folder passed in that path for us
```
---

## Creating a file on the terminal


The `touch` command creates an empty file. 
```
touch about.md
```

---

We can use `ls` to see our working directory now.

---

```
ls
```

---

```
about.md
```

---

``` 
git status
```

---

``` 
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	about.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

---

Notice: Working tree is not clean anymore.  
There is one "untracked file"  


This means the working directory (everything outside .git) had changes but those changes were not **added** to the .git box to be **tracked**

---

```
nano about.md 
```

What year are you in? When do you expect to graduate?

---

Ctrl + s (Only windows users)
Ctrl + x
Enter (Only mac users would need this)

---

we used the [nano text editor](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html).  `nano` is simpler than other text editors that tend to be more popular among experts, `vim` and `emacs`.  Getting comfortable with nano will get you used to the ideas, without putting as much burden on your memory.  This will set you up to learn those later, if you need a more powerful terminal text editor.

---

We put some content in the file, any content then saved and exit. 

On the nano editor the `^` stands for control. 

and we can look at the contents of it. 


Now we will check again with git.

---

`cat` con**cat**enates the contents of a file to standard out, where all of the content that is shown on the terminal is.  

```{Note}
Standard out is a special file in your device that your programs/commands executed will put their output into. The terminal prints the content of standard out (aka: std out), hence we get the output printed on the terminal
```

``` 
cat about.md 
```


and we can see the contents

---


``` 
git status
```

---

```
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	about.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

---
## git add

In this case both say to `git add` to track or to include in what will be committed.  Under untracked files is it says `git add <file>...`, in our case this would look like `git add about.md`.  However, remember we learned that the `.`  that is always in every directory is a special "file" that points to the current directory, so we can use that to add **all** files. Since we have only one, the two are equivalent, and the `.` is a common shortcut, because most of the time we want to add everything we have recently worked on in a single commit.   


`git add` puts a file in the "staging area" we can use the staging area to group files together and put  changes to multiple files in a single commit. This is something we **cannot** do on GitHub in the browser, in order to save changes at all, we have to commit. Offline, we can save changes to our computer without commiting at all, and we can group many changes into a single commit. 


We will use `.` as our "file" to stage everything in the current working directory. 

```
git add .
```

---

And again, we will check in with git


``` 
git status
```

---

``` 
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   about

```


Now that one file is marked as a new file and it is in the group "to be committed". Git also tells us how to undo the thing we just did.

---

Notice: git tells you that if you changed your mind on that file and you don't want it staged to be commited to the next "checkpoint" anymore, you can simply take it out of the staging area using the command `git restore --staged <file_name>`


```{admonition} Try this yourself
:class: anchor

Try making a change, adding it, then restoring it. Use git status to see what happens at each point
```

## git commit
Next, we will commit the file.  We use `git commit` for this. The `-m` option allows us to put our commit message dirctly on the line when we commit.  Notice that unlike commiting on GitHub, we do not choose our branch with the `git commit` command.  We have to be "on" that branch before the `git commit`. 

```{Note}
A commit is a "checkpoint" in your project that you want to save, to be able to go back at any point in time. A commit saves the status of all the files in the project that had been modified since the last check point and **staged** for the new commit
```

``` 
git commit -m "create about - closes #1"
```



We used a [closing keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) so that it will close the issue.

````{margin}
```{important}
If you forget the `-m` you will be put into `vi` or `vim` text editor. Press `a` to enter `~insert" mode (that will appear on the bottom of the terminal window), type your commit message, then press `escape` to exit insert mode. Then type `:wq`and press enter/return  to write(save) and quit.
``` 
````

---
```{Warning}
When you make your first commit you will need to do some [config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) steps to set your email and user name. 
```

``` 
[1-create-an-about-file c7375fa] create about - closes #1
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 about.md
```

---

one more check

``` 
git status
```

---

``` 
On branch 1-create-a-readme
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/1-create-an-about-file' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

```{Note}
Now your working tree is clean again, but your **local** branch (as reflected inside the black box .git) now looks different from what's on the online GitHub repo (Sometimes referred to as the "Upstream")
```

## git push
Git suggests that we use the `push` command to update the online repo with the local one.

---



And push to send to github.com

```
git push
```

Now check out your online repo. Make sure your on the "1-create-an-about-file" branch

about.md should exist now on there!
