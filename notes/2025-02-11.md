# How do git branches work?

We're going to contiue what we've started last week and get more practice on the interaction between git and GitHub


## Reminder


Last week we 
* Created an issue on GitHub (create an about file)
* Created a branch out of that issue (Development)
* Used the command `git fetch` to **fetch** all new changes from GitHub into the `.git` folder
* git told us that there was a new branch created called `1-create-an-about-file`
* We created a local branch that matches the name of the GitHub branch (upstream) with the command `git checkout 1-create-an-about-file`
* We created a new file through the terminal using the `touch` command
* We edited the file using a text editor available to us on the terminal named `nano`
* We added the changed file to the staging area using `git add`
* We commited the change to our local repo using `git commit -m <message>`
* We pushed the changes to the online repo using `git push`

---

Let's pull up our project on the terminal first

```bash
cd ~/Documents/systems/gh-inclass-AymanBx
```

---

Let's also pull up the folder in the file explorer

---

Always remember to check up on the status of your project 
```bash
git status
```

---

```consol
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

Let's take a look at our files 
```bash 
ls -a
```

---

```consol
.         .git
..        .github
about.md
```

## It's not magic

---

What happens if we switch branches? 
Keep an eye on the folder on the side while you switch branches
```bash
git switch main
```

---

Let's take a look at our files now
```bash 
ls -a
```

---

```consol
.         .git
..        .github
```

We can't see the file `about.md`

---

```
git status
```

---

```consol
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

Obviously no changes have been done to main both locally or on GitHub yet which makes sense

---

And finally, Let's pull up the repo online 
```bash
gh repo view --web
```

---

If we're on main we can't see the `about.md` file. Let's change the branch to `1-create-an-about-file`

---

Now we can see the about file on the online inclass repo but only in the `create-about` branch

---

How do we apply the changes (new file) to main?
- [ ] commit
- [ ] git add
- [x] pull request & merge
- [ ] close the issue

---

If GitHub prompts you, select `compare and pull request` 
Or click on `contribute` and then `open pull request`  

---

Merge pull request

---

Back to code section. Now we can see the about.md file!

---

We can also see the the number of issues went down by 1 (from 1 to none)
That's because of two reasons, one of them is because the branch was created from the development section of the issue (effectively liking the issue to the branch and later to the pr). 
The other reason is because of the commit message that we wrote when we created the about file. We'll see this actually take affect in a few minutes.

---

On the terminal

---

```bash 
ls -a
```

---

```consol
.         .git
..        .github
```


The local repo is still unaware of the changes.

---
## Sync

```bash
git fetch
```

---

```consol
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 925 bytes | 154.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-AymanBx
   98ca2d6..4f26167  main       -> origin/main
```

---

```bash
git status
```

---

```consol
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

```bash 
ls -a
```

---

```consol
.         .git
..        .github
```

---

git is aware of some changes that were made. But the changes still aren't reflected on the file system locally.

---

git is so nice. It always gives us pointers as to where to go from here...

---

```bash
git pull
```

---

```consol
Updating 98ca2d6..4f26167
Fast-forward
 about.md | 3 +
 1 file changed, 3 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 about.md
```

---

And finally. One last time 
```bash 
ls -a
```

---

```consol
.         .git
..        .github
about.md
```

## Closing an issue with a commit message

---

Let's create a new issue (if you don't already have one) called `Create a README`
Pay attention to what number that issue is assigned (Marked with a `#`)

---

Back to the code section. Click on add a README button and use the following content

---

contents:
```
# GitHub Practice

Name: <your name here>
```

---

Before you commit, take a look at the issues tab above (don't open it). What is the number showing next to the word `issues`?

---

Commit directly to main. Add to the commit message `closes #<number_of_issue>`

---

Now take another look at the number of issues.

---

What happened?

---

We put the special keyword `closes` in the commit message when we commited the change.

---

"closes #2"

---

What does that mean? What is #2?

---

#2 is referring to the issue `Create a README`. It is labeled #2 on GitHub

---

Go check it out! Open the issues tab and click on `Closed`  
![image](/img/issue_number.png)

---

What does that mean?

---

When we use the [`closes`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) keyword in a commit message, GitHub recognizes that the commit message said `closes #2` and close the issue for us!

Other words that may work: `fixes`, `resolves`, etc.

---

## Branches do not sync automatically

---

Now we go back to the main branch

``` bash

git checkout main
```

---

```console
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

It thinks that we are up to date because it does not know about the changes to `origin/main` yet.

---

``` bash

ls
```

---

```console
about.md
```



the file is missing.  It said it was up to date with origin main, but that is the most recent time we checked github only.  It's up to date with our local record of what is on GitHub, not the current GitHub.

---

Next, we will update locally, with `git fetch`

``` bash

git fetch
```

---

```console
remote: Enumerating objects: 1, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (1/1), 911 bytes | 455.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-AymanBx
   0e7c990..0c12714  main       -> origin/main
```


Here we see 2 sets of messages.  Some lines start with "remote" and other lines do not. 
The "remote" lines are what `git` on the GitHub server said in response to our request and the 
other lines are what `git` on your local computer said. 

So, here, it counted up the content, and then sent it on GitHub's side. On the local side, it unpacked (remember git compressed the content before we sent it). It describes the changes that were made on the 
GitHub side, the main branch was moved from one commit to another. So it then updates the local main branch accordingly ("Updating 6a12db0..caeacb5").

---

We can see that if this updates the working directory too: 

``` bash

ls
```

---

no changes yet. `fetch` updates the .git directory so that git knows more, but does not update our local file system. 

```console
about.md
```

---


### Git Merge

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    branch origin/main
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"A"
    checkout main
    commit id:"F"
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"B"
    checkout main
    commit id:"G"
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"C"
```

---
After merge, it looks like this: 

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    branch origin/main
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"A"
    checkout main
    commit id:"F"
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"B"
    checkout main
    commit id:"G"
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"C"
    checkout main
    merge origin/main id:"H (contains A,B,C)"
```

There is a new commit with the content.

---

In our case it is simpler:

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    branch origin/main
    checkout origin/main
    commit id:"A"
```

so it will fast forward


---

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    commit id:"A"
```

---

### git rebase

If a repo is like this:

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    branch topic
    checkout topic
    commit id:"A"
    checkout main
    commit id:"F"
    checkout topic
    commit id:"B"
    checkout main
    commit id:"G"
    checkout topic
    commit id:"C"
    checkout main
    %% merge topic id:"H (contains A,B,C)"
```


after:

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    commit id:"F"
    commit id:"G" 
    branch topic
    checkout topic
    commit id:"A'"
    commit id:"B'"
    commit id:"C'"
    checkout main
```

---

## Git Pull


remember `git pull` does: 
1. `git fetch`
2. `git merge` (default, if possible) or `git rebase` (if settings or with option)

``` bash
git pull
```

---

```console
Updating 0e7c990..0c12714
Fast-forward
 README.md | 3

---

1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

---

Now, we can check again

```bash
ls
```

---

```console
README.md	about.md
```
and it looks as expected

---

## making a new branch locally

---

We've used `git checkout` to switch branches before. But last time we had created the branch on GitHub first and applied `git fetch`

---

If we use `checkout`and an unkown branch name

```bash
git checkout my_branch
```

---

```console
error: pathspec 'my_branch' did not match any file(s) known to git
```
it give us an error, this does not work


---

`git checkout` expects there to be a branch known in the .git directory. Either a local one or one that was fetched from a remote (upstram/online) repository. If it were the latter, git creates a new local branch that [tracks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches) the online branch (meaning it links them so you can push and pull between them)

---

To create a branch at the same time, we use the `-b` option. with `-b` we can make a new branch and switch to it at the same time.

```bash
git checkout -b my_branch
```

---

```console
Switched to a new branch 'my_branch'
```
so we see it is done!

---

What was this a shortcut for?

---

First let's go back to main

```bash
git checkout main
```
Or

```bash
git switch main
```

---

```console
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

---

`create` does not exist 

```bash
git branch create fun_fact
```

---

```console
fatal: not a valid object name: 'fun_fact'
```
so it tried to treate create as a name and finds that as extra

---

This version gives us two new observations
```bash
git branch fun_fact; git checkout fun_fact
```

---

```console
Switched to branch 'fun_fact'
```
It switches, but does not say it's new.  That is because it made the branch first, then switched.  

The `;` allowed us to put 2 commands in one line.

---

We can view a list of branches:

```bash

git branch
```

---

```console
  1-create-a-readme
  main
* fun_fact
  my_branch
```

---

or again look at the log
```bash

git log
```

---

```console
<enter log here>
```

branches are pointers, so each one is located at a particular commit.

---

the `-r` option shows us the remote ones

```bash

git branch -r
```

---

```console
  origin/1-create-a-readme
  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  origin/main
```


## Merge Conflict

---

```bash
nano about.md 
```

---

we used the [nano text editor](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html).  `nano` is simpler than other text editors that tend to be more popular among experts, `vim` and `emacs`.  Getting comfortable with nano will get you used to the ideas, without putting as much burden on your memory.  This will set you up to learn those later, if you need a more powerful terminal text editor. 


this opens the nano program on the terminal.  it displays reminders of the commands at the bottom of th screen and allows you to type into the file right away.

---

Add any fun fact on the line below your content.  Then, write out (save), it will prompt the file name.  Since we opened nano with a file name (`about.md`) specified, you will not need to type a new name, but to confirm it, by pressing enter/return.

---

```bash
cat about.md 
```

---

```console
Second semster Masters

```

---

```bash
git status
```

---

```console
On branch fun_fact
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

---

```bash

git add about.md 
```


---

```bash
git status
```

---

```console
On branch fun_fact
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   about.md

```

---

**we are going to do it without the `-m` on purpose here to learn how to fix it**

```bash

git commit
```

---

```console
[fun_fact 70759fd] add fun fact
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

```bash
git status
```


```consol
On branch fun_fact

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

without a commit message it puts you in vim. Read the content carefully, then press `a` to get into ~insert~ mode. Type your message and/or uncomment the template. 

When you are done use `escape` to go back to command mode, the ~insert~ at the bottom of the screen will go away.  Then type `:wq` and press enter/return.

---

What this is doing is adding a temporary file with the commit message that git can use to complete your commit.

---

Now let's go back to `main`

```bash
git switch main
```

```consol
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Let's look at the contents of `about.md`

```bash 
cat about.md
```

```console
Second semster Masters

Expected graduation May 2026
```

The file `about.md` in `main` is still unaware of our changes in the `fun_fact` branch

---

How can we apply those changes to `main` locally?

```bash
git merge fun_fact
```

```consol
Updating 8bd4ea3..8040553

Fast-forward
 about.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

--- 

Let's check if that worked:

``` 
git status
```


``` 
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

```bash
cat about.md 
```

---

```console
Second semster Masters

Expected graduation May 2026
- Got my BS in 2023 
```

We can see the updated `about.md` on main now


## Merge conflicts

We are going to *intentionally* make a merge conflict here. 

This means we are learning two things: 
- what *not* to do if you can avoid it
- how to fix it when a merge conflict occurs

Merge conflicts are not **always** because someone did something wrong; it can be a conflict in the 
simplest term because two people did two types of work that were supposed to be independent, but 
turned out not to be.

---

First, in your browser edit the about.md file to have a different fun fact. 

```

Commit changes directly to main

---

Now let's try updating our local repo with a `pull` command


```bash
git pull
```


---

```console
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint:
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint:
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
```

---

Now it cannot work because the branches have diverged.  This illustrates the fact that our two versions of the branch `main` and `origin/main` are two separate things.

---

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    branch fun_fact
    branch origin/main
    checkout fun_fact
    commit
    checkout main
    merge fun_fact
    commit
    checkout origin/main
    commit
    checkout main
```
---

git gave us some options, we will use [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) which will apply our local commits *after* the remote commits. 

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

---

```console
Auto-merging about.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in about.md
error: could not apply 62dcf61... local Added fun fact
hint: Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
hint: "git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
hint: You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
hint: To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
hint: Disable this message with "git config advice.mergeConflict false"
Could not apply 62dcf61... local Added fun fact
```
it gets most of it, but gets stopped at a conflict.

---

```bash
git status
```

---

```console
interactive rebase in progress; onto 462402f
Last command done (1 command done):
   pick 62dcf61 local Added fun fact
No commands remaining.
You are currently rebasing branch 'main' on '462402f'.
  (fix conflicts and then run "git rebase --continue")
  (use "git rebase --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git rebase --abort" to check out the original branch)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

this highlights what file the conflict is in

---

we can inspect this file
```bash

nano about.md 
```

---

```console
Second semster Masters

Expected graduation May 2026
<<<<<<<< HEAD
- I got my BS in 2023
=======
- I graduated from highschool abroad
>>>>>>>> "local main"
```

---

We have to  manually edit it to be what we want it to be.  We can take one change the other or both.

---
```bash
nano about.md
```

In some situations if it's actually the same line of code edited in two different ways you might choose to keep one and throw out the other. In other cases it might be two different lines of code (or fun facts) occupying the same line in the file.
In this case, we will choose to keep both, so my file looks like this in the end.

---

```console
Second semster Masters

Expected graduation May 2026

- I graduated from highschool abroad
```

---

```bash
git status
```



---

```console
interactive rebase in progress; onto 462402f
Last command done (1 command done):
   pick 62dcf61 aded fun fact
No commands remaining.
You are currently rebasing branch 'main' on '462402f'.
  (fix conflicts and then run "git rebase --continue")
  (use "git rebase --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git rebase --abort" to check out the original branch)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

---

Now, we do git add and commit

```bash

git commit -a -m 'keep both changes'
```

---

```console
[detached HEAD c3e68a0] keep both changes
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

---

and check again

```bash
git status
```

---

```console
interactive rebase in progress; onto 462402f
Last command done (1 command done):
   pick 62dcf61 local Added fun fact
No commands remaining.
You are currently editing a commit while rebasing branch 'main' on '462402f'.
  (use "git commit --amend" to amend the current commit)
  (use "git rebase --continue" once you are satisfied with your changes)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

Now, we follow the intructions again, and continue the rebase to combine our branches

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

---

```console
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/main.
```

---

Once we rebase and everything is done, we can push.

---

```bash
git push
```

---

```console

## Summary 

- branches do not synch automatically
- branches are pointers to commits
- every commit knows its parents
- if two different commits have the same parent, when we try to merge we will have divergent branches
- divergent branches can be merged by different strategies
- a merge conflict occurs if, when merging branches, a single file has been edited in two different ways

We often visualize git using graphs like subway maps:


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"A"
    commit id:"B"

    branch fun_fact
    checkout fun_fact
    commit id:"C"
    commit id:"D'"
    checkout fun_fact
    commit id:"E"
```

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
However you can also think of what we learned today like this: 

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    cA[ A <br> commit]
    cB[ B <br> commit]
    cB --> |knows its parent| cA
    cC[ C <br> commit] --> |knows its parent| cB  
    blocal[fun_fact <br> branch] --> |is a pointer to| cC
    bremote[origin/fun_fact <br> branch] --> |is a pointer to| cB
```

Over the next few weeks we will keep refining this understanding.

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Can you have conflicts betwen local branches?  
Absolutely you can. If any two branches whether both are local, both online or one of each edit the same file and try to merge you will get a conflict
 
### What happens where there are multiple people working offline and try to commit all at the same time?  
Same as you would expect. There's no such thing as exactly at the same time. One commit will get pushed before the other one and the other one will either get added to it if it doesn't conflict with the first one or the branch will diverge as we saw in class and the person pushing the second commit will have to fix it.

### How do I know when to use hit switch and when to use for checkout?  
- `git switch` always good for switching between branches and it's safe because it won't create a new branch if one doesn't already exist.
- `git checkout`: switches if a local branch exists. Creates a new branch ONLY if an online branch with the exact same name exits (and it links both branches to each other)
- `git checkout -b`: literally creates a new branch first and then switches to it. It executes two commands: `git branch <name>` + `git checkout <name>`
