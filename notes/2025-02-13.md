## What's happening on this terminal?

Someone asked "How do we make sure a pr's name is good enough for us to get credit on the badge?

Answere: Well, you can use the same tool that I use for grading [courseutils](https://github.com/compsys-progtools/courseutils/)

Let's try it together

```bash
$ cspt checktitle "pracitce  2-11"
```

```console
Usage: cspt [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
Try 'cspt --help' for help.

Error: No such command 'checktitle'.
```

Hmmm...
What went wrong?

Looks like I have the **command** `checktitle` wrong. 
::::{sidebar}
Of course I'm not going to memorize it if I don't need to. I'm a software engineer, I use different tools on the terminal daily. I memorize most of them because of practice. What's important is not to memorize commands but to know where to find them and how to learn about them.
::::

--- 

Well, how do we do that?

```bash
$ cspt --help
```

```console
Usage: cspt [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:

```

This line `Usage: cspt [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...` is what I like to call a signiture line. 

It tell us what the shape of a command in `cspt` would look like.

If we dissect the line:
- `cspt`: The name of the program/tool
- `[OPTIONS]`: Mostly optional **option/flag** that you want your command to include
::::{sidebar} Understanding this piece comes with practice.
This of a command like `commit`. We've used `git commit` as is before, and the command executed, but we still needed to include a commit message and that's why "git" forced us into `vim` to type a commit message. So, the option `-m` was partially optional, but when we use it, we simply add the message right after in double-quotes in the same command and that saves us the trouble.
::::
::::{sidebar}
We've also used the option `-a` with `git commit` last class. And we that we simply asked **git** to allow us to skip doing `git add .` and for it to do it for us.
Or when we created a new local branch with the `checkout` command we used the option `-b` to ask git to create a new branch and then `checkout/switch` to it. 
::::
- `COMMAND`: There a list of commands that this tool will execute for you. Pick one
- `[ARGS]`: If the command requires an argument (mostly a type of input) pass it/add it here

```bash
$ cspt titlecheck "pracitce  2-11"
```

```console
Usage: cspt titlecheck [OPTIONS]
Try 'cspt titlecheck --help' for help.

Error: Got unexpected extra argument (pracitce  2-11)
```

Ok, my command is still missing something, or has something extra (it says extra agrs, but is that really the problem?)

```{Notice}
Notice how nicer tools such as cspt, git and much more are giving you suggesstions and good verbose explainations of what the issue is. Not all developers of such tools are as nice...
```

```bash
$ cspt titlecheck --help
```

```console
Usage: cspt titlecheck [OPTIONS]

  check a single title

Options:
  -t, --pr-title TEXT  title to check as string
  -g, --ghpr FILENAME  pass title as file, or gh pr view output through pipe
  --help               Show this message and exit.
```

Looks like we're missing an option. Aha, not so optional this time...

Notice in this help message we see `-t`, `--pr-title` `TEXT` `title to check as string`
If we dissect this line:
- `-t` & `--pr-title`: are representations of the same option. The developer of this tool [(Dr. Sarah Brown)](https://github.com/brownsarahm) has given the user two ways of using this option, a short way `-t` and a long way `--pr-title`
- `Text`: This is the argument we're passing this command. In this case this is a string with the pull request title
- `title to check as string`: Description

Question: Will there always be a short and a long way to set a flag (option)?
Answer: Not necessarily, this is a convention that a lot of developers abide by. Similar to when you write a variable name in your programming language of choice: 
In python programmers use `snake_case`
In C & C++ programmers mostly use `camelCase`
And these are not rules that if you don't abide by your program will crash. These are naming conventions that are just known and used by most programmers.

```bash
$ cspt titlecheck -t "pracitce  2-11"
```

```console
missing a badge type keyword.
```

Getting closer. I misspelled `Practice`.

```bash
$ cspt titlecheck -t "practice  2-11"
```
```
missing or poorly formatted date
```

```bash
$ cspt titlecheck -t "practice  2-11-2025"
```
```
good
```

```bash
$ cspt titlecheck -t "practice  2025-2-11"
```
```
good
```

```bash
$ cspt titlecheck -t "practice  2/11/2025"
```
```
good
```

We can use the `--help`/`-h` option with more tools
```bash
$ gh -h
```
```

--- 
Terminal is an interface for a shell

--- 
A shell is the outermost layer of an operating system, It is the way for users to communicate or interact with the operating system and make commands

--- 
It is very powerful

--- 
The terminal has programs installed on it such as `nano`, `cat`, `git` and more..
And it has commands that it recognizes `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, etc...

```bash
$ echo hello
```
```
hello
```

```bash 
$ 5+2
```
```
bash: 5+2: command not found
```
::::{sidebar}
Again, I don't have the syntax here memorized, but I can get there I'm sure...
::::


```bash 
$ 5+2
```
```
bash: 5+2: command not found
```

```bash 
$ $(5+2)
```
```
bash: 5+2: command not found
```


```bash 
$ $((5+2))
```
```
bash: 7: command not found
```

Aha!! Notice: this time we got the syntax for mathematical operation correct in `bash`. Because this time `bash` this time evaluated the result and then told us this is not a command

Let's try this one last time 

```bash 
$ echo $((5+2))
```
```
7
```

With this command, we asked bash to `echo`(print out) the evaluated value of `5+2`

`$((5+2))` here was an argument.

---
```bash
cat -h
```
```
cat: unknown option -- h
Try 'cat --help' for more information.
```

Hmmm, `cat` doesn't have the `-h` option. What if...


```bash
cat --help
```

--- 
```console
Usage: cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

  -A, --show-all           equivalent to -vET
  -b, --number-nonblank    number nonempty output lines, overrides -n
  -e                       equivalent to -vE
  -E, --show-ends          display $ at end of each line
  -n, --number             number all output lines
  -s, --squeeze-blank      suppress repeated empty output lines
  -t                       equivalent to -vT
  -T, --show-tabs          display TAB characters as ^I
  -u                       (ignored)
  -v, --show-nonprinting   use ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

Examples:
  cat f - g  Output f's contents, then standard input, then g's contents.
  cat        Copy standard input to standard output.

AH!! `cat` didn't have the **short option** for the option `--help`

Someone asked "How can a terminal command `gh repo view --web` open a browser tab?

`gh` (program/tool)
`repo` (command)
`view` (subcommand)
`--web/ -w` (options/flags)

<Thought here will be completed later>
