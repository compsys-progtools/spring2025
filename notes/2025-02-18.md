The logs are soreted in a latest to oldest manner

---

this is a program, we can use enter/down arrow to move through it and then `q` to exit.

---

Mine will look a bit different that yours because I filled out my README.md later

---

### How does that help?

---

Let's compare

```bash
git switch fun_fact
```

---

```consol
$ git switch fun_fact
Switched to branch 'fun_fact'
```

---

```bash
git log
```

---

```consol

    Added fun fact

commit 8bd4ea38fe31186b9e5d0c1e19c9aef748c6dce6 (my_branch)
Merge: e427044 9e8a8b6

Date:   Tue Feb 11 12:55:21 2025 -0500

    Merge pull request #2 from compsys-progtools/1-create-an-about-file

    Created an about file. Closes #1
```

---

Notice what the parts of each log are

---

- commit: The specific checkpoint of the state of your project. It holds some metadata within it
- Author: The author of the commit. 
  - Notice if you look at the different commits in your logs, you will find two different authors.
  - One that is <your_username>@users.noreply.github.com
  - The other is Your name and email (however your have configured them locally in git)
- Date: Date and time of the commit
- Content: The message you (or GitHub) added to the commit exoplaining what happened in that particular commit

---

What do we notice when we compare both logs?

---

In branch `fun_fact` the latest commit that branch knows about is the one with the commit message "Added fun fact". Everything below matches mostly logs of the `main` branch.
Whereas the logs in `main` show two more commits that are more recent (three im my case)
- One with the message "Update about.md" and the author shows my GitHub user tag (with the @user)
- The other has the message "Keeping both fun facts" with the author being my locally configered user data (Yes, I used my GitHub username as my name because at the time I configerred my username locally I didn't know they didn't HAVE to match)
- We also notice a `Merge` tag on that last commit with some numbers next to it

---

Let's try to make sense of the number in Merge:
```consol
8040553 9942c3c
```

---

Notice the individual commit identifiers (hash) for the two previous commits
**9942c3c**00dcde51d52a1c110413522043eca07cd
**8040553**99f6565aca3cb188fe771ef2dca99f959

---

One more thing we will notice:
- At the latest commit in the `fun_fact` branch we see next to the commit "hash" `(HEAD -> fun_fact)`
- Next to the commit hash below it we only see `(my_branch)`

Whereas in the `main` branch logs we see:
- Next to the latest commit `(HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)`
- Next to the latest commit `fun_fact` branch knows we see `(fun_fact)`. Notice `HEAD` has been moved
- Next to the commit hash below it we only see `(my_branch)`

---

Branches are pointers, each one is located (pointing) at a particular commit.

---

Instead of storing important things in variables that only have scope of how long the program is active git stores its imporant information in files that it reads each time we run a command. All of gitâ€™s data is in the .git directory.

---

Everything the git program uses is stored in the `.git` directory, you can think of that like all of the variables the program would need if it ran all the time. 

```bash
ls .git/
```

---

```console
COMMIT_EDITMSG	REBASE_HEAD	index		packed-refs
FETCH_HEAD	config		info		refs
HEAD		description	logs
ORIG_HEAD	hooks		objects
```

the ones in all caps are simple pointers and the others are other formats.

---

```bash
cd .git/HEAD
```

---

```consol
bash: cd: .git/HEAD: Not a directory
```

---

## What *is* a commit?

---

### Defining terms
A commit is the most important unit of git. Later we will talk about what git as a whole is in more detail, but understanding a commit is essential to understanding how to fix things using git.

---

In CS we often have multiple, overlapping definitions for a term depending on our goal. 

In intro classes, we try really hard to only use one definition for each term to let you focus. 

Now we need to contend with multiple definitions

---

These definitons could be based on 
- what it conceptually represents
- its role in a larger system
- what its parts are
- how it is implemented

---

for a commit, today, we are going to go through all of these, with lighter treatment on the implementation for today, and more detail later.

---

## Conceptually, a commit is a snapshot

![storing data as snapshots over time](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/snapshots.png)


git takes a full *snapshot* of the repo at each commit.  

Under the hood, it only makes a *new* copy of files that have changed because it uses the same technique to store each snapshot, so any files that have not changed, do not create new files inside of git.

---

## A commit's role is central to git

a commit is the basic unit of what git manages

All other git things are defined relative to commits


- branches are pointers to commits that move
- tags are pointers to commits that do not move
- trees are how file path/organization information is stored for a commit
- blobs are how files contents are stored when a commit is made

---

## Parts of a commit

We will learn about the structure of a commit by inspecting it.

---

First we will go back to our `gh-inclass` repo

```
 bash
:tags: ["skip-executio
```
cd Documents/inclass/systems/gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm/
```

---

We can use `git log` to view past commits

```bash
git log
```

---

```consol
<log_here>
```

here we see some parts: 
- hash (the long alphanumeric string)
- (if merge)
- author
- time stamp
- message

but we know commits are supposed to represent some content and we have no information about that in this view

---

the hash is the *unique identifier* of each commit

---

we can view individual commits with `git cat-file` and at least 4 
characters of the hash or enough to be unique.  We will try 4 characters 
and I will use the last (my second to last) visible commit above (`b0b24aa53537557c582b6f61d409e9b2ee91333f`)

`git cat-file` has  different modes:
- `-p` for pretty print
- `-t` to return the type
  
```

Keeping both fun facts
```

---

Here we see the actual parts of a commit file: 
- a pointer to a tree
- a pointer to two parent commits (because this was a merge) (highlighted)
- author info with timestamp
- committer info with timestamp
- commit message

---

### What is the PGP signature?

[Signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) are extra authentication that you are who you say you are. 

The commits that are labeled with the `verified` tag on GitHub.com

---

If we pick a commit from the history on GitHub that does not have `verified` on it, then we can see it does not have the PGP signature

---

## Commit parents help us trace back

kind of like a linked list 


```

```
```{code-cell} bash
git cat-file -p 804055399f6565aca3cb188fe771ef2dca99f959 
```

---

```

---

### Commit trees are the hash of the content

This separation is helpful.

---

The snapshot is stored via a tree, we can use `git cat-file` to look at the tree object too. 

The tree being a separate object from the overall commit allows us to be able to  "edit" a 
message or "change" the parent of a commit; we actually make a *new* commit with the same tree.

---

let's look at the tree for that commit. 
```

```bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 0689
```

---

```
 console
:emphasize-lines: 4
040000 tree 263fb9d22090e88edd2bf1847c24c3511de91b49	.github
100644 blob 9fdc6b1b8d6b0916ef50b0a37e8c31999117016d	.gitignore
100644 blob 9ece5efa25710c8fad7d9f210928785b5362b06f	CONTRIBUTING.md
100644 blob 2d232a2231c650dc4094606797fe0bd3e0ce4c65	LICENSE.md
100644 blob b8eb6e89c6295e574ee5e3363d51c917a16797ff	README.md
040000 tree f596404cd28ea4bad49ff73fb4884049ab0e31f2	docs
100644 blob 39d5708913a6c708d1a505cde6da544785c086a6	setup.py
040000 tree 8c3cc97ca6446c270ca0b8f7d4ce640a6e81e468	src
040000 tree d3980efccf4856f0c61a6a16ed40be53
```230a5	tests
```

in this we have several columns:
- mode (indicates normla file or directory in the working directory)
- `git` object type (block or tree)
- hash of the object
- its file name in the working directory

The highlighted line for `LICENSE.md` we all have the same hash (as long as you picked a commit and tree after that file was created). This is because the hashis of the *contents* and the files all do have the same contents

---

### Trees point to blobs of the file content

We can also use `git cat-file` to view a blob. 
```

```o use `git cat-file` to view a blob. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 2d23
```

---

```
 console
the info on how the code
```n be reused
```

---

```
 bash
:tags: ["skip
```ecution"]

```

## Commits are implemented as files 

commits are stored in the `.git` directory as files.  git itself *is* a file system, or a way of storing information.

---

Everything the git program uses is stored in the `.git` directory, you can think of that like all of the variables the program would need if it ran all the time.

---

```
 bash
:tags: ["skip-execut
```"]
ls .git
```

---

```
 console
COMMIT_EDITMSG	REBASE_HEAD	index		packed-refs
FETCH_HEAD	config		info		refs
HEAD		description	logs
ORIG_HEAD	
```ks		objects
```

the ones in all caps are simple pointers and the others are other formats.

---

Most of the content is in the `objects` folder, git objects are the items that get stored.

---

Recall, we had seen the `HEAD` pointer before
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/HEAD
```

---

```
 console
ref: refs/head
```rganization
```
which stores our current branch

---

```
 bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls 
```t/objects/
```

---

```
 console
06	29	46	72	93	ab	c7	e9
0c	2d	4c	76	94	b0	ca	f1
0e	38	5b	7a	99	b1	cb	f5
10	39	5f	7c	9d	b8	d2	f9
19	3a	62	85	9e	c0	d3	info
1e	3c	63	87	9f	c2	d8	pack
1f	3d	66	8c	a3	c3	dd
25	45	
```91	a8	c5	e0
```
We see a lot more folders here than we had commits.  This is because there are three types of objects.
