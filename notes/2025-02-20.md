# When do I get an advantage from git and bash? 

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
### What is a GPG signature?

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
[Chceck it out](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

It's a way of assuring anyone viewing commits on GitHub tht those commits came from known, safe sources

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
There are ways to configure the signature locally so that local commits are signed and verified.
This is an extra way for collaborators to secure that the commit was made by the person they know and are working with and not someone else.


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
## When do I get an advantage from git and bash? 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
so far we have used git and bash to accomplish familiar goals, and git and bash feel like just extra work for familiar goals. 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Today, we will start to see why git and bash are essential skills: they give you efficiency gains and time traveling super powers (within your work, only, sorry)



+++{"lesson_part":"prismia"}
## Setting the stage
To prepare for today's class you examined an open source project. 

Discuss your prepare work with your neighbors. Share what project you looked at and discuss the following. 
If you all looked at the same repo, split up and look at different ones now. 


- What things were common across different repos?
- What was different? 


+++{"lesson_part":"site"}
We noticed that while the contents inside and the distribution of languages used as well 
as the specific code, or the *content* of the files was all different, a lot of the 
*organization* was similar. 

Most had certain [community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) and basic info files:
- `CONTRIBUTING`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`
- `README.MD`
- `LICENSE`
- `GOVERNANCE.MD`



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
## Important references 

Use these for checking facts and resources. 

- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/docs)


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
## Setup

First, we'll go back to our github inclass folder 

```
cd Documents/systems/github-inclass-AymanBx/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
And confirm we are where we want to be
``` bash
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
/c/Users/Ayman/Documents/systems/github-inclass-AymanBx/
```



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
and make sure we are up to date: 

```
git status
```
We checked if there were any uncommited/unstaged changes that happened locally

+++{"lesson_part":"prismia"}
How do we check for changes that occured online?


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Then we will use fetch to see if we are really up to date

```
git fetch
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
And let's check again to confirm

```
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part":"prismia"}
Let's check for existing prs in the repo


+++{"lesson_part":"prismia"}
Find your PR that I opened for you today that has the title, "2/20 in class activity"


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Note this is optional, and only works with the `gh` cli is installed
```
gh pr list
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
gh pr view
```

+++{"lesson_part":"site"}
Next get the files for today's activity:
1. Find your PR that I opened for you today that has the title, "2/20 in class activity"
2. Mark it ready for review to change from draft
3. Merge it


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Let's open the PR in the browser:

```
gh repo view --web
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
Opening github.com/intcompsys-progtools/github-inclass-AymanBx in your browser.
```
and merge them there. 

To get added to your main branch. 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
git checkout main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now we bring the files to the local repo:

``` bash
git fetch
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```consol

 * [new branch]      organizing_ac -> origin/organizing_ac
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
And let's check for changes

```
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```consol
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
ls
```

```
README.md	about.md
```

Notice that it updated the .git, but not our working directory. 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
cat about.md 
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


But git knows we are behind and tells us how to update


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


```
git pull
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

this message tells us what updates were made



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


## Branches review

We can get a list of the branches we have locally
```
git branch
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


and we can get help to see what options that has with `git branch --help`

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



or see them with their upstream information using the `-vv` for verbose option

```
git branch -vv
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
## Organizing a project (working with files)

A common question is about how to organize projects.  While our main focus
in this class session is the `bash` commands to do it, the _task_ that we are
going to do is to organize a hypothetical python project


Put another way, we are using organizing a project as the *context* to motivate practicing with
bash commands for moving files. 


A different the instructor might go through a slide deck that lists commands and describes what each one does and then have examples at the end.  Instead, we are going to focus on organizing files, and I will introduce the commands we need along the ways. 




+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
next we are going to pretend we worked on the project and made a bunch of files 

I gave a bunch of files, each with a short phrase in them. 

- none of these are functional files
- the phrases mean you can inspect them on the terminal


+++{"lesson_part":"prismia"}
\pin file extensions are for people; they do not specify what the file is actually written like


+++{"lesson_part":"site"}
```{note}
file extensions are for people; they do not specify what the file is actually written like
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
these are all *actually* plain text files


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
what command can we use to view the contents of a file named `my.file`

- [ ] shw my.file (short for show)
- [ ] prt my.file (short for print)
- [x] cat my.file (short for concatenate)
- [ ] dis my.file (short for display)


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
`cat` concatenates the contents of a file to stdout, which is a special file that our terminal reads 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
(think about in C you can write to STDOUT or STDERR, some IDEs have separate visual panels for these two places)


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
create a new branch from main.

```
git checkout -b organization
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
What advantage does making a new branch here give us? 

- [ ] its required for changes
- [ ] allows us to test things before putting them on main
- [ ] it creates a beautiful tree eventually


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
git status
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
## Files, Redirects, git restore


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
cat README.md 
```



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

Echo allows us to send a message to stdout.

```
echo "age=36"
```


+++{"lesson_part":"prismia"}
Let's connect what we are about to learn to something you have probably seen before. 

Think about a time you opened a file within a program that you wrote. For example
- `fopen` in C
- or `open` in Python

in both cases one parameter is the file to open, what other parameters have you used?


+++{"lesson_part":"site"}

Typically, when we write to a file, in programming,  we also have to tell it what *mode* to open the file with, and some options are: 
- read
- write
- append


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

References

- [C language docs from IBM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.2.0?topic=functions-fopen-open-file)
- [Python official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open)


*C is not an open source language in the typical sense so there is no "official" C docs*


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
We can **redirect** the contents of a command from stdout to a file in `bash`. Like file operations while programming there is a similar concept to this mode. 

There are two types of redirects, like there are two ways to write to a file, more generally: 
- overwrite (`>`)
- append (`>>`)


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
We can add contents to files with `echo` and `>>`


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
echo "age=35" >> README.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

Then we check the contents of the file and we see that the new content is there. 
```
cat README.md 
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

We can redirect other commands too: 

```
git status >> curgit
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

we see this created a new file
```
ls
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
LICENSE.md		curgit			test_help.py
README.md		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
_config.yml		important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
about.md		overview.md
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
and we can look at its contents too
```
cat curgit 
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
this is not a file we actually want, which gives us a chance to learn another new bash command: 
`rm` for remove

```
rm curgit 
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Note that this is a true, full, and complete DELETE, this does not put the file in your recycling bin or the apple trash can that you can recover the file from, it is **gone** for real. 

We will see soon a way around this, because git can help. 

*use `rm` with great care*


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Now we have made some changes we want, so let's commit our changes.  

```
git commit -m 'add age to readme'
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Now, let's go back to thinking about redirects. We saw that with two `>>` we appended to the file.  With just *one* what happens? 

```
echo "age=35" > README.md 
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
We check the file now
```
cat README.md 
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
It wrote over.  This would be bad, we lost content, but this is what git is for! 

It is *very very* easy to undo work since our last commit.  

This is good for times when you have something you have an idea and you do not know if it is going to work, so you make a commit before you try it. Then you can try it out.  If it doesn't work you can undo and go back to the place where you made the commit. 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
To do this, we will first check in with git

```
git status
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Notice that it tells us what to do `(use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)`.  The version of README.md that we broke is in the working directory but not commited to git, so git refers to them as "changes" in the workign directory. 



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
git restore README.md 
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
this command has no output, so we can use git status to check first


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
git status
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
and it looks like it did before the `>` line. and we can check the file too
```
cat README.md 
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Back how we wanted it! 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

Now we will add some text to the readme


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```

```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
this explains each file a little bit more than the name of it does.
We see there are sort of 5 groups of files:
- about the project/repository
- code that defines a python module
- test code
- documentation
- extra files that "we know" we can delete.

We also learn something about bash: 
using the open quote `"` then you stay inside that until you close it. when you press enter the command does not run until after you close the quotes



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
cat README.md 
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
## Getting organized


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
First, we'll make a directory with `mkdir`
```
mkdir docs
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
next we will move a file there with `mv`

```
mv overview.md docs/
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
what this does is change the path of the file from `.../github-inclass-AymanBx/overview.md` to `.../github-inclass-AymanBx/docs/overview.md`


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
This doesn't return anything, but we can see the effect with `ls`
```
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
We can also use `ls` with a relative or absolute path of a directory to list tht location instead of our current working directory. 
```
ls docs/
```

```
overview.md
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
### Moving multiple files with patterns


let's look at the list of files again.


```
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
What patterns are there in the file names that relate to what the file is for? 

(use your readme or cat the files)


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
We can use the `*` [wildcard operator](https://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm) to move all files that match the pattern. We'll start with the two `yml` [(yaml)](https://yaml.org/)
files that are both for the documentation.
```
mv *.yml docs/
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Again, we confirm it worked by seeing that they are no longer in the working directory.

```
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

and that they *are* in `docs`

```
ls docs/
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
We see that most of the test files start with `tests_` but one starts with
`tsets_`. We can fix this!


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

We can use `mv` to change the name as well. This is because "moving" a file and
is really about changing its path, not actually copying it from one location to
another and the file name is a part of the path.

```
mv tsets_abc.py tests_abc.py 
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

This changes the path from `.../tsets_abc.py` to `.../tests_abc.py` to. It is doing the same thing as when we use it to move a file from one folder to another folder,  but changing a different part of the path. 

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
ls
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Now we make a new folder: 

```
mkdir tests
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

and move all of the test files there:


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
this is why good file naming is important even if you have not organized the
whole project yet, you can use the good conventions to help yourself later.


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
mv test_* tests/
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```
ls
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

## Hidden files 

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

We are going to make a special hidden file and an extra one. We will use the following command: 

```
touch .secret .gitignore
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
We also learn 2 things about `touch` and `bash`:
- `touch` can make multiple files at a time
- lists in `bash` are separated by spaces and do not require brackets

The **list** `.secret .gitignore` is a single `ARG` that was passed to the command



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
lets put some content in the secret (it will actually *not* be going to GitHub)

```
echo "my dev secret" >> .secret
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
git status
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

gitignore lets us *not* track certain files

let's ignore that `.secret` file 

```
echo ".secret" >> .gitigore
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
git status
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
gitignore works on patterns too!


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
mkdir my_secrets
cd my_secrets
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
touch a b c d e f 
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
echo "my_secrets/*" >> .gitignore
```
+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
git status
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Copying a file 

`cp` copies 
```bash

cp README.md docs/overview.md
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```bash

git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/organization'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```bash

## Recap

Why do I need a terminal
1. replication/automation
1. it's always there and doesn't change  
1. it's faster one you know it (also see above)



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

```
So, is the shell the feature that interacts with the operating system and then the terminal is the gui that interacts with the shell?
```

## Experience Report Evidence

Save your history with: 
```
history > activity-2025-02-20.md
```

then append your git status, and the contents of your github-in-class and github-in-class/docs with  to help visually separat the parts. 

```bash
echo "***--" >> activity-2023-02-07.md
git status >> activity-2023-02-07.md
echo "***--" >> activity-2023-02-07.md
ls >> activity-2023-02-07.md
echo "***--" >> activity-2023-02-07.md
ls docs/ >> activity-2023-02-07.md
```
then edit that file (on terminal, any text editor, or an IDE) to make sure it only includes things from this activity.
