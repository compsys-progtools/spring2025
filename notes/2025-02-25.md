### What happens if we copy to a folder that has a file of the same name?


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```bash
touch overview.md
echo "Hello hello... " > overview.md
cat overview.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```
Hello hello...
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```bash
cat docs/overview.md
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```
# Practice

My name is Ayman
age = 27
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```bash
cp overview.md docs/overview.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```bash
cat docs/overview.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```
Hello hello...
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```{Note}
Terminal is not going to tell you "There's already a file with the same name pick the one you want to keep or keep both etc..."
Terminal expects you to be aware and responsible of your actions.
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Let's fix it with the new content we just added to readme


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```bash
cp README.md docs/overview.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```{Attention}
Not only did we copy the **content** of the README file to a new location. We gave the new file a different name at the same time. 
If using File Explorer you'd have to `Ctrl + C` from one place , `Ctrl + V` into the new place, then rename the file from README.md to overview.md.
We did all of that in one command!!
```

If I edited multiple files in a repo, how can I stage all of them? 

- [ ] git add f1, f2, f3
- [x] git add .
- [ ] git add -a
- [ ] git add 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
If I edited multiple files in a repo, why would I want NOT to stage all of them at once? 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We might not want to add everything all at once because we think specific changes ought to have their own commit

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```bash
git add README.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Notice how when we added **all** yml files. git added the new ones and the deleted ones (staged the deletion of the ones that were moved)
It then recognized the moving of the files into the docs folder as "renaming" with two different paths being the old and new names.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Notice also how now it specifies that there are two more files that are new to the docs/ directory and aren't staged. One of which was moved from the main directory (example.md)

Is there a quick way to add all of them?

How do you feel about learning the social aspects of computing? 

*pick one or send your own*

- [ ] it helps me feel included and understand better
- [ ] it is practically useful, but I do not enjoy it
- [ ] I think it is pointless and should not be in CS courses

<!-- added from previous lecture -->
+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}
## Why do we need this for computer systems?

+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

### Computer Systems are designed by people

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Computer Science is not a natural science like biology or physics where we try
to understand some aspect of the world that we live in.  Computer Science as a
discipline, like algorithms, mostly derives from Math.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


So, when we study computer science, while parts of it are limited by physics, most of it is essentially an
imaginary world that is made by people.  Understanding how people think, both
generally, and common patterns within the community of programmers
understand how things work and why they are the way they are.  The why can also
make it easier to remember, or, it can help you know what things you can find
alternatives for, or even where you might invent a whole new thing that is
better in some way.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


 Of course, not *all* programmers think the same way, but when
people spend time together and communicate, they start to share patterns in how
they think. So, while you do **not** have to think the same way as these patterns,
knowing what they are will help you reading code, and understanding things.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### Context Matters



This context of how things were developed can influence how we understand it.
We will also talk about the history of computing as we go through different
topics in class so that we can build that context up.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### Optimal is relative

The "best" way to do something is always relative to the context.  "Best" is a
vague term.  It could be most computationally efficient theoretically,
fastest to run on a particular type of hardware, or easiest for another programmer
to read.  





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
# Why are these tools like this? 



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Discussion

At your tables: 

- share your responses to the work in the prep work for today's topic
- discuss any similiarities or differences
- if any, send back questions you have
- if any, send points you want to share to the whole class



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"formative"}


How did the  processes, decisions, and practices that people at your table brought up compare to what you thought of?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Design
In CS we tend to be more implicit about design, but that makes it hard to learn and keep track of. 

Today's goal is to be more explicit, disucssing some principles and seeing how you have already interacted wit them. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



Today we're going to do a bit more practical stuff, but we are also going to start to get into the philosophy of how things are organized.  

Understanding the context and principles will help you:
- remember how to do things 
- form reliable hypotheses about how to fix problems you have not seen before
- help you understand when you should do things as they have always been done and when you should challenge and change things.  




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why should we study design? 


- it is easy to get distracted by implementation, syntax, algorithms
- but the core *principles* of design organize ideas into simpler rules





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why are we studying developer tools? 

> The best way to learn design is to study examples [Schon1984, Petre2016], and some of the best examples of software design come from the tools programmers use in their own work. 

[Software design by example](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

*note*

- we will talk about some history in this course

This is because: 
- I think that history is important context for making decisions
- when people are deeply influential, ignoring their role in history is not effective, we cannot undo what they did
- we do not have to admire them or even say their names to acknowledge the work
- computing technology has been used in Very Bad ways and in Definitely Good ways

## Unix Philosophy

sources:
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
- [a free book](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html)

- composability over monolithic design 
- social conventions 


The tenets: 

1. Make it easy to write, test, and run programs.
1. Interactive use instead of batch processing.
1. Economy and elegance of design due to size constraints ("salvation through suffering").
1. Self-supporting system: all Unix software is maintained under Unix.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For better or [worse](http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/people/smalley/ESCI7205_misc_files/The_truth_about_Unix_cleaned.pdf) unix philosophy is dominant, so understanding it is valuable. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This critique is written that unix is not a good system for  "normal folks" not in its effectiveness as a context for *developers* which is where *nix (unix, linux) systems remain popular. 


context:  
_"normal folks" is the author's term; my guess is that it is attempting to describe a typical, nondeveloper computer user_
_terminology to refer to people has changed a lot over time; when we study concepts from primary sources, we have to interpret the document through the lens of what was normal at the time the document was written, not to excuse bad behavior but to not be distracted and see what is there_

#  You should keep the prepare, because they are required for experience badges 
#     You may choose to get only the review or only the practice (and change this any time) 
# added comment to fix
```

A lot of this is familiar, but we are focused today on the three highlighed lines 


Here we see a few key things: 
- on the last line it uses a pipe `|` to connect a command `sysgetassignment` to the `gh issue create` command. 
- the `gh issue create` command uses the `--body-file` option with a value  `-`; this uses std in, but since this is to the right of the pipe, it puts the output of the first command into this option
- the 2nd to last line creates a variable (we will learn this more later) and the last line uses that variable
- the `Install Utils` step, installs some custom code.

We know that this action is what is used to create badge issues, so this custom code must be what gets information from the course website to get the assignments and prepare them for your badge issues.

Let's try the one we saw in the action
```bash

cspt getassignment --type prepare
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```  console
404: Not Found
```


With default settings, it says 404.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We know that it goes online.  So, for example, if you turn your wifi off and then try it again, you will get a different error. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To learn more about this, lets use the `--help` option.  
A lot of CLI tools have this option.  In this program, that I made, 
the Python library `click` that I used to make this, provides the `help` option automatically to show the documentation or lets me as the developer add help text to options. 

```bash

cspt getassignment --help
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```  console
Usage: cspt getassignment [OPTIONS]

  get the assignment text formatted

Options:
  --type TEXT  type can be {prepare, review, or practice}; default prepare
  --date TEXT  date should be YYYY-MM-DD of the tasks you want; default most
               recently posted
  --help       Show this message and exit.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we can see that it can take some options.  

If we do not provide a date, I can tell you (and I should add to the documentation), it uses today's date.  Since we ran this on a day with class, before the badges were posted, the file it looked for did not exist, so we got 404. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can use the options to get the last posted prepare work
```bash

cspt getassignment --type prepare --date 2024-09-26
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
