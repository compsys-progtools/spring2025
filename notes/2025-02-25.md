Today we will continue organizing the github inclass repo as our working example.  

Navigate to your inclass repo  

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

Now we will add some text to the readme file

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
cat docs/overview.md

```{Attention}
Not only did we copy the **content** of the README file to a new location. We gave the new file a different name at the same time. 
If using File Explorer you'd have to `Ctrl + C` from one place , `Ctrl + V` into the new place, then rename the file from README.md to overview.md.
We did all of that in one command!!

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
If I edited multiple files in a repo, how can I stage all of them? 

- [ ] git add f1, f2, f3
- [x] git add .
- [ ] git add -a
- [ ] git add 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
`git add .` is the common way to add everything. Why?

Because the `.` is a special to the **current** directory, so everything that has been changed inside this directory gets staged with this command.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
What about the command `git add f1, f2, f3`?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Well, the only thing wrong about this command is something we've talked about before. Lists in `bash` are separated by a **space** ` ` not a **comma** `,`

So if we did `git add f1 f2 f3` that would've worked. The only thing that's annoying about this method is the waste of time when writing the name of every single file that I want to add when I can simply "select all" with the special character `.`.

But if we were staging more than one file all at once but NOT all the file then this is a perfect way to do so.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
And finally, what about `git add -a`?

Well, let's check is there such an option `-a`?
```bash
git add -h
```

```
usage: git add [<options>] [--] <pathspec>...

    -n, --[no-]dry-run    dry run
    -v, --[no-]verbose    be verbose

    -i, --[no-]interactive
                          interactive picking
    -p, --[no-]patch      select hunks interactively
    -e, --[no-]edit       edit current diff and apply
    -f, --[no-]force      allow adding otherwise ignored files
    -u, --[no-]update     update tracked files
    --[no-]renormalize    renormalize EOL of tracked files (implies -u)
    -N, --[no-]intent-to-add
                          record only the fact that the path will be added later
    -A, --[no-]all        add changes from all tracked and untracked files
    --[no-]ignore-removal ignore paths removed in the working tree (same as --no-all)
    --[no-]refresh        don't add, only refresh the index
    --[no-]ignore-errors  just skip files which cannot be added because of errors
    --[no-]ignore-missing check if - even missing - files are ignored in dry run
    --[no-]sparse         allow updating entries outside of the sparse-checkout cone
    --[no-]chmod (+|-)x   override the executable bit of the listed files
    --[no-]pathspec-from-file <file>
                          read pathspec from file
    --[no-]pathspec-file-nul
                          with --pathspec-from-file, pathspec elements are separated with NUL character
```

There isn't such an option as `-a`, BUT, there is an option `-A` or `--all` that `add changes from all tracked and untracked files`

Now we know üòÅ





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's remove the new file we  created for the experiment 
```bash
rm overview.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
If I edited multiple files in a repo, why would I want NOT to stage all of them at once? 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We might not want to add everything all at once because we think specific changes ought to have their own commit

git add README.md

_config.yml  _toc.yml  example.md  overview.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We moved a bunch of files related to documentation to the `docs/` folder. Let's stage and commit these changes separate than other changes


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
What is a quick way for me to add all yml files?



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```bash
git add *.yml
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```bash

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

        tests/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Notice how when we added **all** yml files. git added the new ones and the deleted ones (staged the deletion of the ones that were moved)
It then recognized the moving of the files into the docs folder as "renaming" with two different paths being the old and new names.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Notice also how now it specifies that there are two more files that are new to the docs/ directory and aren't staged. One of which was moved from the main directory (example.md)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We also notice that two new files start with docs/
Is there a quick way to add all of them?

## Discussion

At your tables: 

- share your responses to the work in the prep work for today's topic
- discuss any similiarities or differences
- if any, send back questions you have
- if any, send points you want to share to the whole class



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"formative"}
How did the  processes, decisions, and practices that people at your table brought up compare to what you thought of?


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Design

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
In CS we tend to be more implicit about design, but that makes it hard to learn and keep track of. 

Today's goal is to be more explicit, disucssing some principles and seeing how you have already interacted wit them. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Today we're going to do a bit more practical stuff, but we are also going to start to get into the philosophy of how things are organized.  

Understanding the context and principles will help you:
- remember how to do things 
- form reliable hypotheses about how to fix problems you have not seen before
- help you understand when you should do things as they have always been done and when you should challenge and change things.  




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why should we study design? 
- it is easy to get distracted by implementation, syntax, algorithms
- but the core *principles* of design organize ideas into simpler rules





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
### Why are we studying developer tools? 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
> The best way to learn design is to study examples [Schon1984, Petre2016], and some of the best examples of software design come from the tools programmers use in their own work. 

[Software design by example](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

*note*

- we will talk about some history in this course

This is because: 
- I think that history is important context for making decisions
- when people are deeply influential, ignoring their role in history is not effective, we cannot undo what they did
- we do not have to admire them or even say their names to acknowledge the work
- computing technology has been used in Very Bad ways and in Definitely Good ways 





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
## Unix Philosophy


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
sources:
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
- [a free book](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html)

- composability over monolithic design 
- social conventions 


The tenets: 

1. Make it easy to write, test, and run programs.
1. Interactive use instead of batch processing.
1. Economy and elegance of design due to size constraints ("salvation through suffering").
1. Self-supporting system: all Unix software is maintained under Unix.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
For better or [worse](http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/people/smalley/ESCI7205_misc_files/The_truth_about_Unix_cleaned.pdf) unix philosophy is dominant, so understanding it is valuable. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
This critique is written that unix is not a good system for  "normal folks" not in its effectiveness as a context for *developers* which is where *nix (unix, linux) systems remain popular. 


context:  
_"normal folks" is the author's term; my guess is that it is attempting to describe a typical, nondeveloper computer user_
_terminology to refer to people has changed a lot over time; when we study concepts from primary sources, we have to interpret the document through the lens of what was normal at the time the document was written, not to excuse bad behavior but to not be distracted and see what is there_

When we use it without a subcommand, it gives us help output a list of all the commeands that we can use.  If it is *not* working, you would get a `command not found` error.

```

A lot of this is familiar, but we are focused today on the three highlighed lines 




Here we see a few key things: 
- on the last line it uses a pipe `|` to connect a command `sysgetassignment` to the `gh issue create` command. 
- the `gh issue create` command uses the `--body-file` option with a value  `-`; this uses std in, but since this is to the right of the pipe, it puts the output of the first command into this option
- the 2nd to last line creates a variable (we will learn this more later) and the last line uses that variable
- the `Install Utils` step, installs the tool that we've talked about before called courseutils..

We know that this action is what is used to create badge issues, so this custom code must be what gets information from the course website to get the assignments and prepare them for your badge issues.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's try the one we saw in the action
```bash

cspt getassignment --type prepare
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```  console
404: Not Found
```


With default settings, it says 404.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We know that it goes online.  So, for example, if you turn your wifi off and then try it again, you will get a different error. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To learn more about this, lets use the `--help` option.  
A lot of CLI tools have this option.  In this program, that I made, 
the Python library `click` that I used to make this, provides the `help` option automatically to show the documentation or lets me as the developer add help text to options. 

```bash

cspt getassignment --help
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```  console
Usage: cspt getassignment [OPTIONS]

  get the assignment text formatted

Options:
  --type TEXT  type can be {prepare, review, or practice}; default prepare
  --date TEXT  date should be YYYY-MM-DD of the tasks you want; default most
               recently posted
  --help       Show this message and exit.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we can see that it can take some options.  

If we do not provide a date, I can tell you (and I should add to the documentation), it uses today's date.  Since we ran this on a day with class, before the badges were posted, the file it looked for did not exist, so we got 404. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can use the options to get the last posted prepare work
```bash

cspt getassignment --type prepare --date 2024-09-26
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

## Questions After Today's Class 


### why would we not stage all files in a repo all at once 
In case you wanted to separate the work you've made into different commits (checkpoints) to possibly deploy each one separately and make sure your main doesn't break. And if main does break, you can tell which commit caused it to fail to run or deploy because you don't have too many changes all in one commit.
