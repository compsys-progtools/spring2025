# Unix Philosophy In Practice

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Philosophy in practice, using pipes


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Last class we experimented with creating issues from the terminal with a command from the `gh` CLI (**C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We also looked at the `getassignment.yml` workflow and we noticed how badges get posted.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
One thing we saw here was being able to write a script to automate a bunch of actions in our repo easily

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
But the main thing we noticed was being able to use two commands from two separate tools together at once to complete a job

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Think of the line we saw 
```YAML
cspt getassignment --type practice | gh issue create --title $pratitle --label practice --body-file -
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Here we saw a few key things: 
- It uses a pipe `|` to connect a command `cspt getassignment` to the `gh issue create` command. 
- the `gh issue create` command uses the `--body-file` option with a value  `-`which means to use stdin
- but since this is to the right of the pipe, it puts the output of the first command into this option


We know that this action is what is used to create badge issues, so this custom code must be what gets information from the course website to get the assignments and prepare them for your badge issues. 

::::{sidebar}
Remember, the term `pipe` referse to a method to acheive "interprocess" communication. Not neccessarily only connecting the input of one process to the output of the other. Interprocess communication is used in many different situations, some of which might be when dividing a task into multiple sub-processes (multiprocessing) to use the full potential of the device and make the task quicker, one might need to construct a way for the subprocesses to communicate with each other to divide the work between them correctly, or to report results to each other or to the parent process.
There are more use cases of pipes and multiprocessing than the two examples mentioned.
::::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
One of the Unix Philosophy ideas were to make sure the input and output of a program are text streams to make it easier to connect different programs with each other and make them work together 

"Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input"



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### Installing from source

As we saw in the action, we can install python packages from source via git.  let's install the new version of the code



```bash

pip install git+https://github.com/compsys-progtools/courseutils@main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
For those of you who are having issues with the environment `externally managed environment` remember to run the virtual environment we talked about in lab


```{Attention}
Do the following step outside of either one of your repos. A good place to run this command would be the `Systems` folder or `CSC311` folder. As long as its not inside either repo folders.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Create a Python **v**irtual **env**ironment

```bash
python venv -m venv 
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Run the virtual environment

:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} macos/linux
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

::::

::::{tab-item} windows
```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Remember, this tool searches for the assignment information on the course website, so if the assignments weren't posted yet we get an error message


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's try the one we saw in the action
```bash
cspt getassignment --type prepare
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```{code-block} console
404: Not Found
```


With default settings, it says 404.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We know that it goes online.  So, for example, if you turn your wifi off and then try it again, you will get a different error code. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To learn more about this, lets use the `--help` option.  
A lot of CLI tools have this option.  In this program, that Prof. Sarah Brown made, 
the Python library [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) that is used to make this, provides the `help` option automatically to show the documentation or lets the developer add help text to options. 


```bash

cspt getassignment --help
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
Usage: cspt getassignment [OPTIONS]

  get the assignment text formatted

Options:
  --type TEXT  type can be {prepare, review, or practice}; default prepare
  --date TEXT  date should be YYYY-MM-DD of the tasks you want; default most
               recently posted
  --help       Show this message and exit.
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we can see that it can take some options.  

If we do not provide a date, I can tell you (and I should add to the documentation), it uses today's date and attempts to get the next class' prepare info.  Since we ran this on a day with class, before the badges were posted, the file it looked for did not exist, so we got 404. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can use the options to get the last posted prepare work
```bash

cspt getassignment --type prepare --date 2025-02-25
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
And let's take a look at the `gh issue create` command options



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```bash

gh issue create --help
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```{code-block} console

### Interactive Design


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We saw that if we just run the command without any options we get the interactive issue design 


```bash
gh issue create

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Notice that when you get to the body of the issue, if you're a windows user, gh might prompt you to hit `enter` to launch `notepad` or possibly `nano`. If you're a macos/linux user gh will most likely prompt you to hit `enter` to launch `nano`. 

Type the content of the issue body (issue description). and either save and exit with `notepad` or `ctrl + o` --> `enter` --> `ctrl + x` with nano.

Most students didn't find two remote repos. Not sure if the reason for that is the way the repo was cloned into your local device. Or some configuration settings on your device

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can change which of those is a default

```bash

gh repo set-default origin
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
expected the "[HOST/]OWNER/REPO" format, got "origin"
```

I forgot the format and tried to use the short name, `origin` when `gh` requires it tobe in `owner/repo` format, but this error is informative, so we know what to do: 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now, let's do more work on the inclass repo

Navigate to inclass repo

```bash
cat README.md

When I copied the content that I wanted to add to the README file the arrows from my terminal got copied as well, ruining the table in markdown syntax we were trying to create


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's try to fix this with codespace

```bash
gh remote view --web
```
```
unknown command "remote" for "gh"

Usage:  gh <command> <subcommand> [flags]

Available commands:
  alias
  api
  auth
  browse
  cache
  classroom
  co
  codespace
  completion
  config
  extension
  gist
  gpg-key
  issue
  label
  org
  pr
  project
  release
  repo
  ruleset
  run
  search
  secret
  ssh-key
  status
  variable
  workflow
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
The correct command is `repo` not `remote`

```bash
gh repo view --web
```

```
Opening github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-AymanBx in your browser.
```

We don't see any of the changes we had made to this repo organizing the files


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Let's try switching to the `Organization` branch

Ooh! There isn't an `Organization` branch!!

Let's check what's going on locally..

```bash
git status
```

```
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    tests_alt.py
        deleted:    tests_helpers.py
        deleted:    tests_imp.py
        deleted:    tsets_abc.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .gitignore
        tests/
        
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Hmmm, No mentions on whether this branch is up to date with an online branch, aheah or behind...

That's becuase we created this branch locally and we've been working locally all this time but we never pushed this branch or the changes made to it online

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
```bash
git push
```

```
fatal: The current branch test has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin Organization

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
```

This message is basically telling me, in order to push changes to GitHub, you must have a branch on GitHub (preferrably with the same name) to track  the changes that occur to your local branch.
It gives us a hint on how to do so...

Now, let's work on GitHub Codespace



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
[Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) are a virutal machine that you can use VSCode on in browser.  You only have VSCode access to this system, but VSCode with the terminal is a lot of power. 


+++{"lesson_part":"prismia"}



If VSCode is new to you, use their documentation of the [VSCode interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) to get oriented to the different parts of the screen. 




+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
today we will also work in github codespaces. 

1. Navigate to your github inclass repo on Github.com
2. Use the link in the README or the green code button to open a new codespace on main. 

when your codespace is open, share its name (first part of the url 2 words)



+++{"lesson_part":"prismia"}
a codespace is a virutal machine on a cloud platform, not cloud access to github.com

what might that mean about how we use it? 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
- you need to commit changes
- codespace is linux


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
**this is why we learn bash in this class**

as developers, we will all interact with linux/unix at times, so bash is the best shell to know if you only know one or do not want to switch between multiple


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Multiple cursors are your friend

[docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_multiple-selections-multicursor)



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Let's use multiple cursors to remove the unnecssary `>` and extra line in our READMEs

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
Remember to `add`, `commit` and `push`

Codespace is a virtual machine, any work you do on it will need the same process that you would do on the personal device. 

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}   


```
if your push gets rejected, read the hints, it probably has the answer.  
```




## Hack the course

>build and explore ideas 

Develop new command line tools, github actions, VS Code (or other IDE) extensions, visual aids, etc. that help future students in the course.  This is a way for you to demonstrate your learning and contribute to open source repos that you can then link to on a portfolio website or resume


You can participate in this at different levels (or multiple):
- build: writing, documenting at the API level, and configuring major pieces (can be collaborative)
- explore: writing example/tutorial style docs that another student (or team) build (mostly solo; open to justification for collab)
- explore: adding summary/visuals to the notes
- community: (test option): testing other students contributions and making descriptive issues or writing short reviews (~3-5 sentenccs); must not be spammy
- community: (review option): reviewing PRs submitted by a classmate (can be within a collaborative build, but must be not your own code) a single PR can have multiple reivews if sensible and not duplicative; no spam
- community: (contribution) add a glossary term to this site

## Recap

Why do I need a terminal
1. replication/automation
1. it's always there and doesn't change  
1. it's faster when you know it



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}   

```
So, the shell the feature that interacts with the operating system and then the terminal is the gui that interacts with the shell
```




+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}
## Why do we need this for computer systems?

+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}
### Computer Systems are designed by people

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Computer Science is not a natural science like biology or physics where we try
to understand some aspect of the world that we live in.  Computer Science as a
discipline, like algorithms, mostly derives from Math.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
So, when we study computer science, while parts of it are limited by physics, most of it is essentially an
imaginary world that is made by people.  Understanding how people think, both
generally, and common patterns within the community of programmers
understand how things work and why they are the way they are.  The why can also
make it easier to remember, or, it can help you know what things you can find
alternatives for, or even where you might invent a whole new thing that is
better in some way.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
 Of course, not *all* programmers think the same way, but when
people spend time together and communicate, they start to share patterns in how
they think. So, while you do **not** have to think the same way as these patterns,
knowing what they are will help you reading code, and understanding things.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### Context Matters

This context of how things were developed can influence how we understand it.
We will also talk about the history of computing as we go through different
topics in class so that we can build that context up.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### Optimal is relative

The "best" way to do something is always relative to the context.  "Best" is a
vague term.  It could be most computationally efficient theoretically,
fastest to run on a particular type of hardware, or easiest for another programmer
to read.
