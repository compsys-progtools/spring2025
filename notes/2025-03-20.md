# How can I automate things with bash?


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

Review the GitHub Action file that was used last lab as well as action workflow files in your kwl repo. Make note of what if any syntax in there is unfamilar. 




+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

Today our goal is to learn more about how those things work. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So far we have used bash commands to navigate our file system as a way to learn about the file system itself. To do this we used commands like:
- `pwd`
- `cd`
- `ls` 
- `mv`
- `cp`
- `rm`
- `find`


*do you remember what each of those does?, no need to respond, just think through it for yourself*



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Bash is a unix shell for the GNU operating system and it has been adopted in other contexts as well. It is the default shell on Linux Ubuntu as well many others. This is why we learn about it here. GNU is a recursive acronym that stands for "GNU's Not Unix". It is a Unix-like completely free system

Use [mermaid](https://mermaid.live/) or the prismia drawing tool to visualize the relationship between the following terms: 
- bash
- shell
- terminal
- git

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
A Unix shell is referring to both a command interpreter and a programming language. As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the rich set of GNU utilities. The programming language features allow these utilities to be combined. 


Read the official definition of `bash` and a shell in [the bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Introduction)

## Inspecting an example script


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Today we will start by inspecting the github action file, first we'll navigate to the folder. 


```bash
cd OneDrive\Desktop\URI\CSC311\collab-activity
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Next we'll look at which files we have

```bash

ls .github/workflows/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
generate_problem.yml
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's look at the file

```bash

cat .github/workflows/generate_problem.yml
```
```
name: Generate Problem

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      problem_number:
        description: "Enter problem number (1, 2, or 3)"
        required: true
        type: choice
        options:
          - "1"
          - "2"
          - "3"
      programming_language:
        description: "Enter programming language (Python or C++)"
        required: true
        type: choice
        options:
          - "Python"
          - "Cpp"

jobs:
  setup_problem:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Debug - List files before renaming
        run: ls -lah


      - name: Reserve the old Readme file
        run: |
          mv README.md about.md
          ls -lah

      - name: Copy problem files to the main folder
        run: |
          PROBLEM_DIR=".github/Problems/Problem${{ github.event.inputs.problem_number }}/${{ github.event.inputs.programming_language }}"
          if [ -d "$PROBLEM_DIR" ]; then
            cp -r "$PROBLEM_DIR"/* "."
            echo "Problem file copied successfully."
          else
            echo "Error: Problem file does not exist!" && exit 1
          fi


      - name: Commit and push changes
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions"
          git config user.email "github-actions@github.com"
          git add .
          git commit -m "Add new problem files"
          git push


      - name: Create issue for the problem
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          ISSUE_FILE=".github/Problems/Problem${{ github.event.inputs.problem_number }}/issue.md"
          gh issue create \
            --title "Problem ${{ github.event.inputs.problem_number }}" \
            --body-file "$ISSUE_FILE"
```

We notice some lines that we are very familiar with.
We see lines that `mv` and `cp` files. We also see a set of actions that will `add`, `commit` and `push`. So we see how we automate commands that we have used normally before on a terminal within this script to make it execute all these commands with the action run.


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

What features do you expect if something is a programming language?



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Variables in Bash



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

From the action files what do you think the syntax for a variable in bash is? Give an example by creating a variable called `MYVAR` with the value `my_val`


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can create variables
```
NAME='Ayman'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Do you see a variable declaration in the workflow script?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```yml
ISSUE_FILE=".github/Problems/Problem${{ github.event.inputs.problem_number }}/issue.md"
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

notice that there are **no spaces** around the `=`. spaces in bash separate commands and options, so they cannot be in variable declarations.  




+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}

what is the syntax for using a variable? 
*try them out and find which is correct, or use code inspection on your actionfile*

- [ ] NAME>
- [x] $NAME
- [ ] NAME$
- [ ] NAME


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

echo `NAME` with a `$` before the variable name.


```bash

echo $NAME
```
```
Ayman
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

A common mistake is to put a space around the `=` sign, this is actually considered **good style** in many other languages. 


```bash
NAME = 'Ayman'
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
-bash: NAME: command not found
```


In bash, however, this creates an error.  When there is a space after `NAME`, `bash` tried to interpet `NAME` as a bash command, but then it does not find it, so it gives an error. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Removing the space works again: 
```bash
NAME='Ayman Sandouk'
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



This variable is local, in memory, to the current terminal window, so if we open a separate window and try `echo $NAME` it will not work. We can also see that it does not create any file changes. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```bash
ls
```
```
README.md  calculator.cpp  calculator.py  calculator.rs
```
We don't see anything referring to the `$NAME` variable


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can, however use the variable at different working directories in the same terminal. So if we move

```bash
cd ../Spring2025/
echo $NAME
```
```
Ayman Sandouk
```


echo still works. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The `$` is essential syntax for recalling variables in bash. If we forget it, it treats it as a literal

```bash
echo NAME
```
```
NAME
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


so we get the variable **name** out instead of the variable **value**




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Environment Variables

Environment variables are global among all termial windows. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

A common one is the `PATH`

```bash

echo $PATH
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
/c/Users/ayman/bin:/mingw64/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/mingw64/bin:/usr/bin:/c/Users/ayman/bin:/c/Program Files/Python313/Scripts:/c/Program Files/Python313:/c/Program Files (x86)/Common Files/Oracle/Java/java8path:/c/Program Files (x86)/Common Files/Oracle/Java/javapath:/c/Program Files (x86)/VMware/VMware Workstation/bin:/c/Windows/system32:/c/Windows:/c/Windows/System32/Wbem:/c/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0:/c/Windows/System32/OpenSSH:/c/Program Files (x86)/NVIDIA Corporation/PhysX/Common:/c/Program Files/NVIDIA Corporation/NVIDIA NvDLISR:/c/WINDOWS/system32:/c/WINDOWS:/c/WINDOWS/System32/Wbem:/c/WINDOWS/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0:/c/WINDOWS/System32/OpenSSH:/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI:/c/ProgramData/chocolatey/bin:/cmd:/c/Program Files/dotnet:/c/Users/ayman/AppData/Roaming/Python/Python313/Scripts:/c/Users/ayman/.cargo/bin:/c/Users/ayman/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps:/c/Users/ayman/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/bin:/c/Users/ayman/AppData/Local/Pandoc:/c/Users/ayman/AppData/Local/Programs/Ollama:/c/Users/ayman/.dotnet/tools:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl
```

mine shows multiple paths that will have packages installed in them, yours may be different

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

You can store environment variables to be set each time you start a terminal 
in your profile. 

- On MacOS this file is: `~/.bash_profile`
- on linux it is `~/.bashrc`
- For windows users you should also have `~/.bashrc`
    - If you don't have it you can create it with `touch` and edit it to add any global variables you want
  
```bash

cat ~/.bashrc
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

A common one you might want to set is: 
- `PS1` the primary prompt line. Content you can use is [documented in the gnu docs](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Controlling-the-Prompt)
- `alias` lets you set another name for a program, for exmaple I use `pip` to call `pip3`

## GH Actions as an example of scripts
As seen, we use scripts to run a collection of commands together with one call/ run of that action


Check out the [github action marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) to see other actions that are available and try to get a casual level of understanding of the *types* of things that people use actions for. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}




## Bash Loops

We can also make loops like

```bash
for loopvar in list
do
# loop body
echo $loopvar
done
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So, for example: 

```bash
$ for name in Ayman madison greg sean
> echo $name
```
```
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `echo'
```
I'm got the "open loop" part wrong.
Similar to how we use `{` in C & C++ or how we use `:` and indentation in Python. Bash has its own way of opening and closing a loop and that's `do` & `done`

```bash
for name in Ayman madison greg sean
> do 
> echo $name
> done
```
```
Ayman
madison
greg
sean
```


Notes:

- The `>` is not typed, it is what happens since the interpreter knows that
after we write the first line, the command is not complete.
- a list in bash is items with spaces, no brackets here (`Ayman madison greg sean`)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

When we get the command back with the up arrow key, it puts it all on one line, because it was one command.  The `;` (semicolon) separates the "lines"

```bash
for name in Ayman madison greg sean; do echo $name; done
```




What if we wanted to run the loop on a large list?
We can make the list into a variable

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```bash
NAMES="Ayman madison sean greg tyler trevor"
```

```bash
for name in $NAMES
> do 
> echo $name
> done
```
```
Ayman
madison
sean
greg
tyler
trevor
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
## Nesting commands
We can take the output of a command and put it in a variable or directly use it like we would use a variable


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

Can you find an example of a command being using nested in any of your kwl action files? 

If we looked at `getassignment.yml`
We see a bunch of lines that we've edited and worked on before.

```yml
        # prepare badge lines
        pretitle="prepare-"$(cspt getbadgedate --prepare)
        cspt getassignment --type prepare | gh issue create --title $pretitle --label prepare --body-file -
```
We used a familiar command `cspt getbadgedate` to generate a variable 

If we did this in our own terminals
```bash
cspt getbadgedate --prepare
```
```
2025-03-25
```
We get next class' date.
Notice how in the script we combine it with `prepare-`
Let's do the same thing in our terminal


```bash
pretitle="prepare-"$(cspt getbadgedate --prepare)
```
```

```

Now, let's print the variable
```bash
echo $pretitle
```
```
prepare-2025-03-25
```


Let's see how many files we have in this directory
```bash
ls
```
```
LICENSE      _prepare/     faq/         notes/
README.md    _review/      files.sh     references.bib
_config.yml  _static/      genindex.md  requirements.txt
_data/       _toc.yml      img/         resources/
_lab/        _worksheets/  index.md     syllabus/
_practice/   activities/   logo.png     systools.png
```

Can we use a loop to print out each file at a time?


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can run a command to generate the list and then use that list as a variable by putting it inside `$()` to run that command first.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Let's move to inclass repo
```bash
cd ~/Documents/systems/gh-inclass-AymanBx
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```bash
for file in $(ls)
> do 
> echo $file
> done
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

the `$()` tells bash to run that command first and then hold its output as a variable for use elsewhere




+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

Find a use of this in your experience report actions




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



We can modify what is in the `$()`:

## Conditionals in bash

What are other programming language feature we would expect from a programming language like bash?




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can also do conditional statements
```bash
if test -f docs
> then
> echo "file"
> fi 
```

the key parts of this: 
- `test` checks if a file or directory exists
- the `-f` option makes it check if the item is a *file*
- what to do if the condition is met goes after a `then` keyword
- the `fi` (backwards`if`) closes the if statment

Once again, similar to other programming languages. In bash to open and close an `if` statement we use `if`, `then` and `fi` to close the if statement 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This outputs nothing because `docs` is a directory not a file. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we switch it, we get output: 

```bash
if test -f README.md; then echo "file"; fi 
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can put the if inside of the loop. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Once we put `then` in, it works: 

```bash
for file in $(ls)
> do
>   if test -f $file
>   then
>       echo $file
>   fi
> done
```

```{Notice} 
Indentation is completely optional here. We just use it so that the code looks more familiar.

## Script files 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can put our script into a file to automate more that one step all in one call

```
nano filecheck.sh 
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Let's get creative 
```bash
# Introduction
echo "Hello and welcome to your first script"

echo "Hello world!"

# Now listing files only
for file in $(ls -a)
do
    if test -f $file
    then
        echo $file" was found"
    fi
done

# Farewell
echo
echo "Goodbye!"
```

We can see that that file lives in out repo now
```bash
ls
```
```
API.md                  filecheck.sh
CONTRIBUTING.md         helper_functions.py
LICENSE.md              important_classes.py
README.md               my_secrets/
about.md                philosophy.md
abstract_base_class.py  scratch.ipynb
alternative_classes.py  setup.py
docs/                   tests/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and run it with `bash <filename>`

```
bash filecheck.sh 
```
```

Remember, extensions from a computer's prespective don't matter. We use them only for us a humans to be able to tell what a file represents

```bash
mv filecheck.sh filecheck
bash filecheck
```

## `gh` CLI operations 

When you are working sometimes it is helpful to be able to manipulate (or create) issues, pull requests or even releases from the command line. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is how I post announcements. I work on the notes (a markdown file) in vs code and then I use the vscode terminal to commit, push, create a tag, and create a release. I can post the notes and notify you all that they are posted without leaving VScode at all; this makes it much simpler/faster than it would be using Brightspace




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



We can also search and filter them by piping the output to `grep` which searches the **contents** of a file (including stdin). We previously searched the file **names** with `find`.  So `find` searches the paths that exist and `grep` actually reads the contents of the files, it does so faster than many other languages would be.

`grep` can be used with pattern matching as well 

```bash
gh issue list -s all | grep "Lab"
```
