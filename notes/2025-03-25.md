# Why did we learn the plubming commands?

You will not typically use them on a day to day basis, but they are a good way to see what happens at the interim steps and make sure that you have the right understanding of what git does.  

A **correct** understanding is essential for using more advanced features





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

While there is of course some content that we want you to know after this course, my goal is also to teach you process, by modeling it.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

No one will ever know all of the things but you can be fast or slow at finding answers. 

And you can find correct answers, incorrect answers, or looks-okay-but-you-will-regret-this-later answers. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

you do not want to become the colleague that everyone regrets working with




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Today's Questions
- What are references?
- How can can I release and share my code?
- How else can git help me? 


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}

When does the contents of a file get hashed?

- [ ] every time you edit a file, git hashes it automatically
- [x] when a file is staged for commit
- [ ] any time a staged file is edited 
- [ ] when the commit is created


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}

What type of git object stores the name of a file?

- [x] tree
- [ ] blob
- [ ] commit
- [ ] branch



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
## What does git status do? 

_compares the working directory to the current state of the active branch_ and the index


- we can see the working directory with: `ls`
- we can see the active branch in the `HEAD` file 
- what is its status? 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Recall that we: 
- crated a blob objct directly
- created a file
- hashed the file, to create its blob object
- added the file to the index
- wrote a tree from files in the index
- created a commit object with a tree and a commit message
- copied the commit hash and placed it inside a new file `.git/refs/heads/main` using `echo` and `>`


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Let's use inspection to review where our repo is left off from last week. 




```bash

git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
On branch main


Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Branches are references
branches are not git objects, they are references.  

We can see that by where they are stored.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

How can we inspect to see where references are stored? 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

using ls and/or find


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see our list of object with `find`

```bash

find .git/objects/ -type f
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
.git/objects//0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//d8/329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
.git/objects//e3/ba10cb02de504d4f48b9af4934ddcc4d0be3df
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

Since we made most of these objects as not commits, the hashes are mostly shared, but one of the hashes is unique so we worked together to identify that one. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Then for that unique hash, we confirmed it was a commit using `git cat-file` to view its type
```bash

git cat-file -t e3ba
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
commit
```
 as expected



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now let's look at what the `HEAD` pointer says to try to understand why it does not see that commit, since we know that git status works from `HEAD`

```bash

cat .git/HEAD 
```
```
.git/refs/heads/main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"important"}
```{important}
git updates the file for the branch each time you add a commit with `git commit`, the first time `git commit` is run it also creates the file
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we look in the folder, we can see what is in there
```bash

ls .git/refs/heads/
```
```
main
```
```bash
cat .git/refs/heads/main
```
```
e3ba10cb02de504d4f48b9af4934ddcc4d0be3df
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Updating a branch manually


The branch file is named as the branch (here `main`) and stored in the `.git/refs/heads/` folder and contains the full hash of the commit that branch is pointing to.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Since we made the commit manually, we need to move the branch manually too. We will use echo, by copyting the full hash from above (I copied the part after the last `/` in the list of objects above and then typed the `e3` before pasting).  

Mine looks like:

```bash

echo e3ba10cb02de504d4f48b9af4934ddcc4d0be3df > .git/refs/heads/main
```

but your commit hash will be different than mine. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we check with git again: 

```bash

git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

and now we can see that it no longer sees the staged file and *does* see our commit. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
git cat-file -p 188a
```

```
tree d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
author Ayman Sandouk <Ayman_sandouk@uri.edu> 1677177139 -0500
committer Ayman Sandouk <Ayman_sandouk@uri.edu> 1677177139 -0500

first commit
```


```bash
git log
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So we now have HEAD-> main and main -> our commit -> tree --> blob. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Branches in git are references to specific commits.


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
## Git Tags



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To practice this, lets go to the github inclass repo


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
cd gh-
```

(this is not the full name of the directory, but starting with this and then pressing tab will get you there)


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}


The other type of git reference is called a tag. There are two types of tags: 

- a lightweight tag is like a branch that does not move
- an annotated tag is a git object, like a commit almost. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see where they are stored in the `refs` folder: 

```bash

ls .git/refs/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
heads	remotes	tags
```

Remember:
-  heads are branches (like `main`)
-  remotes are servers that we can push to (eg `https://github.com/...`)



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Before we make a tag, let's make sure we are on the most up to date main. 
First we check the branch and working directory: 
```bash

git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

main, clean working tree is good. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Next we pull to update from github
```bash

git pull
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 955 bytes | 136.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-sp24-Ayman_sandouk
 * [new branch]      1-create-a-add-a-classmate -> origin/1-create-a-add-a-classmate
Already up to date.
```

and we get the updates

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now, to make a tag we use `git tag <name of tag>` to create a lightweight tag

```bash

git tag v3.0
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This command has no output, but we will inspect


```bash

ls .git/refs/tags/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
v3.0
```

we see this created a file for the tag,

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we will look at this too

```bash

cat .git/refs/tags/v3.0
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
0d6ef1d3db0729088d515b35b588f39af5b770fd
```

the lightweight tag is just like a branch, another pointer to the commit. 

The difference is that this does not move when we create new commits, so this is like a shortcut to a specific commit. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see the tag relative to branches in the log as well:

```bash

git log
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we push:
```bash

git push
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
Everything up-to-date
```

we see nothing happens initially. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Tags have to be pushed explicitly


```bash

git push --tags
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can look at how [tags are represented on github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags). After opening the repo up in browser: 

```bash

gh repo view --web
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Tags enable {term}`release`s, where are [defined on github as](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases):

>Releases are deployable software iterations you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use.


We can [create a relese for the tag we made](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release)



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### We can checkout any commit, not jsut branches

```
git checkout 188a
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
```
Note: switching to '188a'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 188a75e first commit
```

we can follow from this warning. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
cat .git/HEAD 
```

```
188a75ef66b6a85be0ab68d8575ec27808881dfc
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
This changes the head pointer directly to the commit. 

```
ls
```
```
test.txt
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and checkout also updates the working directory

```
cat test.txt 
```
```

```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```
git checkout test
```

```
Switched to branch 'test'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## What is a hash?


a hash is:
- a fixed size value that can be used to represent data of arbitrary sizes
- the *output* of a hashing function
- often fixed to a hash table




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



Common examples of hashing are lookup tables and encryption with a cyrptographic hash.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



A hashing function could be really simple, to read off a hash table, or it can
be more complex.



+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"table"}



For example:

```{list-table}

* - Hash
  - content
* - 0
  - Success
* - 1
  - Failure
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



If we want to represent the status of a program running it has two possible
outcomes: success or failure. We can use the following hash table and a function
that takes in the content and returns the corresponding hash. Then we could pass
around the 0 and 1 as a single bit of information that corresponds to the outcomes.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


This lookup table hash works here.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



In a more complex scenario, imagine trying to hash all of the new terms you learn
in class. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

A table would be hard for this, because until you have seen them all, you
do not know how many there will be.  A more effective way to hash this, is to
derive a *hashing function* that is a general strategy.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



A *cyrptographic* hash is additionally:
- unique
- not reversible
- similar inputs hash to very different values so they appear uncorrelated



Now lets go through each of these properties

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### Cryptographic Hashes are unique

This means that two  different values we put in should give different results. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
For this property alone, a simple function could work: 

```python
def basic_unique(input):
    return input
```

but this is not a hash because its length would not be constant and not a cryptographic has because it is easily reversible. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### Cryptographic Hashes are not reversible

This means that given the hash (output), we cannot compute the message(input). 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Any function that gives the same output for two (or more) values meets this criteria.

for example  modulus: 


```python
13%3
```
```
1
```

```python
10%3
```
```
1
```

It can be any function that gives the same output for two (or more) values.
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

but this is not a cryptographic hash



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



We can use the git hashing algorithm without writing to the repo too: 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Then we get the hash back. Try changing the input just a little and running the hashing algorithm again.  

do similar inputs have similar hashes? 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### Similar inputs lead to seemingly uncorrelated outpus

We can see this using git:

```bash

echo "it's almost spring" | git hash-object --stdin
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
1327354a0d47111e361ec52acc46b9509bed69a0
```
and we get a hash

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and then we change it just a little bit:

```bash

echo "it's almsot spring" | git hash-object --stdin
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```console
f798473089b4a00684cd0f13a6f2d1d7a0e033ba
```

and now the hash is completely different

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### Hashes are fixed length

So, no matter the size of the input, we get back the same length. 

This is good for memory allocation reasons. 


We could again write a function that only does this simply: 

```Python
def fixed_len(input):
    '''
    pad or trim 
    '''
    len_target=100
    str_in = str(input)
    if len(str_in)< len_target:
        return str_in.ljust(len_target,'-')
    else:
        return str_in[:len_target]
```

Back to it being not a cryptographic hash

Try ```fixed_len("lkjhlkjhlkjhlkjlkjhlkjhlkjhlkjhkljhjlkhlkjhlkjhlkjhlkjhkjlhkjlhhhhhjlhlfgfgfgfgfgfgfgfgfkjhlkjhljkhnbh123")```
Try ```fixed_len("lkjhlkjhlkjhlkjlkjhlkjhlkjhlkjhkljhjlkhlkjhlkjhlkjhlkjhkjlhkjlhhhhhjlhlfgfgfgfgfgfgfgfgfkjhlkjhljkhnbh258")```


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"formative"}

What are some ways a hash could be used? 



+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"heading"}

## How can hashes be used?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Hashes can then be used for a lot of purposes:
- message integrity (when sending a message, the unhashed message and its hash are both sent; the message is real if the sent message can be hashed to produce the same hash)
- password verification (password selected by the user is hashed and the hash is stored; when attempting to login, the input is hashed and the hashes are compared)
- file or data identifier (eg in git)





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}



### Hashing in passwords 


Passowrds can be encrypted and the encrypted information is stored, then when you submit a candidate password it can compare the hash of the submitted password to the hash that was stored.  Since the hashing function is nonreversible, they cannot see the password.  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



[Password Breach blog post](https://www.troyhunt.com/how-spoutibles-leaky-api-spurted-out-a-deluge-of-personal-data/)




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Some sites are negligent and store passwords unencrypted, if your browser warns you about such a site, proceed with caution and definitely do not reuse a password you ever use. (you *should never* reuse passwords, but especially do not if there is a warning)



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


An attacker who gets one of those databases, cannot actually read the passwords, but they could build a lookup table.  For example, "password" is a bad password because it has been hashed in basically every algorithm and then the value of it can be reversed.  Choosing an uncommon password makes it less likely that your password exists in a lookup table. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For example, in SHA-1 the hashing algorithm that git uses

```bash

echo "password" | git hash-object --stdin
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Hashing in Git

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



In git we hash the content directly to store it in both the database (.git) directory
and the commit information.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Recall, when we were working in our test repo we created an empty repository and
then added content directly, we all got the same hash, but when we used git
commit our commits had different hashes because we have different names and
made the commits at different seconds. 

We also saw that *two* entries were
created in the `.git` directory for the commit.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Git was originally designed to use SHA-1. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Then the [SHA-1 collision attack](https://shattered.io/) was discovered


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

 Git switched to hardened HSA-1 in response to a collision.


>  In that case it adjusts the SHA-1 computation to result in a safe hash. This means that it will compute the regular SHA-1 hash for files without a collision attack, but produce a special hash for files with a collision attack, where both files will have a different unpredictable hash.
[from](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/44141/what-is-hardened-sha-1-how-does-it-work-and-how-much-protection-does-it-offer).



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

[they will change again soon](https://git-scm.com/docs/hash-function-transition/)


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"hint"}
GitHub *uses* git, it is not an alternative implementation or a fork, so yes
it will switch too. The developers at GitHub an other git hosts are among the most impacted by
the change since they write code that directly interacts with git objects. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

git uses the SHA hash primarily for uniuqeness, not privacy


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

It does provide some *security* assurances, because we can check the content
against the hash to make sure it is what it matches.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is a Secure Hashing Algorithm that is derived from cryptography.  Because
it is secure, no set of mathematical options can directly decrypt an SHA-1  hash.
It is designed so that any possible content that we put in it returns a unique
key. It uses a combination of bit level operations on the content to produce the
unique values.



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"mcq"}

The SHA-1 Algorithm hashes content into a fixed length of 160 bits.

how many different possible hashes can it produce?
- [ ] 160*160
- [x] 2^160
- [ ] 160*2
- [ ] 160^2



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

 This means
it can produce $2^{160}$ different hashes. Which makes the probability of a collision very low.


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

The number of randomly hashed objects needed to ensure a 50% probability of a single collision is about $2^{80}$ (the formula for determining collision probability is $p = (n(n-1)/2) * (1/2^160))$. $2^{80}$) is $1.2 \times 10^{24}$ or 1 million billion billion. That’s 1,200 times the number of grains of sand on the earth.

## Questions


### How to tags exactly work?
Similar to branches, an individual task will point at a specific commit (by holding a commit's hash in its corresponding file). So one can easily use a tag to mark an important state of their project that they never want to lose. The difference between a branch and a tag is that a branch moved with each commit or can be moved with merges, rebases, pushes, pulls etc. A tag cannot.
