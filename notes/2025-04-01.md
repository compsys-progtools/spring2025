# What happens when I build code in C?




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type","heading"}
## What is *buiding* code?

Building is transforming code from some input format (some text for example) into the final desired format.  

This can mean different things in different contexts. For example:
- the course website is built from markdown files into html output using jupyter-book
- a C program is built from C source code to executable that the machine can understand as the output

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We sometimes say that compiling takes code from source to executable, but this process is actually multiple stages and compiling is *one* of those steps.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will focus on *what* has to happen more than *how* it all happens.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
CSC301, 402, 501, 502 go into greater detail on how languages work.  

Our goal is to:

- (where applicable) give you a preview
- get enough understanding of what happens to know where to look when debugging

## Creating SSH Keys


## Using ssh keys to authenticated

1. generate a key pair
1. store the public key on the server
1. Request to login, tell server your public key, get back a session ID from the server
1. if it has that public key, then it generates a random string, encrypts it with your public key and sends it back to your computer
1. On your computer, it decrypts the message + the session ID with your private key then hashes the message and sends it back
1. the server then hashes its copy of the message and session ID and if the hash received and calculated match, then you are loggied in



[a toy example](https://thatsmaths.com/2016/08/11/a-toy-example-of-rsa-encryption/)



![cheatsheet on ssh from julia evans](https://wizardzines.com/comics/ssh/ssh.png)

[from wizardzines](https://wizardzines.com/comics/ssh/)



Lots more networking detals in the [full zine](https://wizardzines.com/zines/bite-size-networking/) available for purchase or I have a copy if you want to borrow it.


this *free zine* describes networks at a lower level [full zine](https://jvns.ca/networking-zine.pdf) but does not include ssh


## Generating a Key Pair

We can use `ssh-keygen` to create a keys.

- `-f` option allows us to specify the file name of the keys.
- `-t` option allows us to specify the algorithm 
- `-b` option allows us to specify the size



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/seawulf -t rsa -b 1024
```





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
## Sending the public key to a server

again `-i` to specify the file name
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/seawulf ayman_sandouk@seawulf.uri.edu
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Logging in



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
To login without usng a password you have to tell ssh which key to use:
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/seawulf ayman_sandouk@seawulf.uri.edu
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Or you can add the following to your `~/.ssh/config` file
```
Host seawulf
  Hostname seawulf.uri.edu
  Username ayman_sandouk
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/seawulf
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and then use
```
ssh seawulf
```







<!-- Without config... -->
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Using SSH Keys

We are going to work on seawulf so that we all have the same compiler. 

To use it we use he `-i` option and then the path to the private key file

```bash

ssh -i ~/seawulf ayman_sandouk@seawulf.uri.edu
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
Last login: Tue Apr  4 11:53:06 2023 from 172.20.207.131
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Using an interactive session

Last class we worked on the login node, but that is not best practice. 

Today we will use an interactive session using the `interactive` program. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
The login node has limited resources, and is only usually used to connect to the server and possibly run batch jobs from there. The login node resources are shared among many users, so, out of courtesy, we try not to occupy these resources too much or for too long


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

First we'll look at its help
```ayman_sandouk
Usage: interactive [-c] [-p] [-J] [-w]

Optional arguments:
    -c: number of CPU cores to request (default: 1)
    -p: partition to run job in (default: general)
    -J: job name (default: interactive)
    -w: node name

NB: interactive jobs have a time limit of 8 hours.

Written by: Alan Orth <a.orth@cgiar.org>
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Then we will start one with all default settings

```bash

[ayman_sandouk@seawulf ~]$ interactive
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```ayman_sandouk
salloc: Granted job allocation 27371
salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
salloc: Nodes n005 are ready for job
```

it tells us what it is doing while it gets ready. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We see that the prompt changes, now we are `@n005` instead of `@seawulf`, lets check out working directory: 

```bash

[ayman_sandouk@n005 ~]$ ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```ayman_sandouk
bash-lesson.tar.gz                           SRR307026_1.fastq

SRR307025_1.fastq                            SRR307030_1.fastq
SRR307025_2.fastq                            SRR307030_2.fastq
```

our files are still there.  The *compute* node changed, but not our disk space location. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

And our working directory is the same: 
```bash

[ayman_sandouk@n005 ~]$ pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```ayman_sandouk
/home/ayman_sandouk
```

still our home directory

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will make an empty directory to work in for today. 
```bash

[ayman_sandouk@n005 ~]$ mkdir compilec
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and go into it to work
```bash

[ayman_sandouk@n005 ~]$ cd compilec/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```bash
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## A simple program

```bash

 nano hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"output"}

and we will put in a simple hello world 
program



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}


```C
#include <stdio.h>
void main () {

 printf("Hello world\n");

}
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We will see this is the only file in the folder
```bash
ls
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Preprocessing with gcc

First we handle the preprocessing which pulls in headers that are included in our source code.  We will use the compiler [gcc](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will use `gcc` for many steps. We will use different options that it offers to do subsets of the complete compile task: 

- `-E` stops after preprocessing
- `-o` makes it write the .i file and passes the file name for it


```bash
gcc -E hello.c -o  hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
If it succeeds, we see no output, but we can check the folder
```bash
ls
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

now we have a new file

```
hello.c  hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

If we think that the `.i` file might be big, what can we use to compare the two to see the impact of preprocesing?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can inspect what it does using `wc`
```bash

 wc -l hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
6 hello.c
```

we started with just 6 lines of code



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and we can compare that to the preprocessed file:
```bash

 wc -l hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
842 hello.i
```

and see we get a lot more




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```C
#include <stdio.h>
void main () {

 printf("Hello world\n");

}
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Since it is long, we will fist look at the top

```bash

 head hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
# 1 "hello.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 1 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "hello.c"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 1 3 4
# 27 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4
# 1 "/usr/include/features.h" 1 3 4
# 375 "/usr/include/features.h" 3 4
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and the end
```bash

 tail hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```

extern void funlockfile (FILE *__stream) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__));
# 943 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4

# 2 "hello.c" 2
void main () {

 printf("Hello world\n");

}
```

we see that our original program, is at the end of the file, and the beginning is where the include line has been expanded. 

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

````{margin}
```{admonition} Try it yourself
Look at this whole file, try changing the base program to remove the include and then see what the preprocessed file is like
```

```{note}
I have set this cell to use C syntax highlighting even though on a terminal output it would not
```
````
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Compiling

Next we take our preprocessed file and compile it to get assembly code.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Again, we use `gcc`:
- `-S` tells it to produce assembly
- we will use the preprocessed file as input

```bash

 gcc -S hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

but we can see what it output: 
```bash

 ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
hello.c  hello.i  hello.s
```

we have a new file as well with the `.s` extension. Notice how we didn't need to use the -o option this time

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Again, lets inspect
```bash

 wc -l hello.s
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
25 hello.s
```

this is longer than the source, but not as long as the header. The header contains lots of information that we *might* need, but the assembly is only what we *do*. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

And it's manageable, so we inspect it directly: 
```bash

 cat hello.s
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
	.file	"hello.c"
	.section	.rodata
.LC0:
	.string	"Hello world"
	.text
	.globl	main
	.type	main, @function
main:
.LFB0:
	.cfi_startproc
	pushq	%rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
	.cfi_offset 6, -16
	movq	%rsp, %rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_register 6
	movl	$.LC0, %edi
	call	puts
	popq	%rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa 7, 8
	ret
	.cfi_endproc
.LFE0:
	.size	main, .-main
	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-44)"
	.section	.note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
```


There are many more steps. These are lower level operations, but they are still text stored in the file.



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
```{hint}
Learning more about assembly languages is a good explore badge topic
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Assembling


Assembling is to take the assembly code and get object code.  Assembly is relatively broad and there are families of assembly code, it is also still written *for humans* to understand it readily.  It's more complex than source code because it is closer to the hardware.  The object code however, is specific instructions to your machine and not human readable.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Again, with `gcc`:
- `-c` tells it to stop at the object file
- `-o` again gives it the name of the file to write

```bash

 gcc -c hello.s -o hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

Again, check what it does by looking at files
```bash

 ls
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
hello.c  hello.i  hello.o  hello.s
```
now we see a new file, the `.o`



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and again check its length
```bash

 wc -l hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}


```
5 hello.o
```
this is even shorter, 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we can check how many characters and words
```bash

 wc  hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
   5   17 1496 hello.o
```

it is not even too many characters

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
let's look at it
```bash

 cat hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```

This is not human readable, though:



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Linking

Now we can link it all together; in this program there are not a lot of other depdencies, but this fills in anything from libraries and outputs an executble



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

once again with `gcc`:
-  `-o` flag specifies the name for output
-  `-lm` tells it to link from the .o file.

```bash

 gcc -o hello hello.o -lm 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
hello  hello.c  hello.i  hello.o  hello.s
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Finally we can run our program

```bash

 ./hello
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
Hello world
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Putting it all together


We can repeat with a different name and work directly from source to executable: 

```bash

 gcc -o demohello hello.c -lm
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and run again. 

```bash

 ./demohello 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
it runs the same
```
Hello world
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
if we link the object file
```bash

 gcc -o hello hello.o -lm 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and run
```bash

 ./hello 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
we see no change
```
Hello world
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we can build completely from source that we editied and run
```bash

 gcc -o hello hello.c -lm 
 ./hello 
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
gcc --help
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



```bash
gcc -Wall -g -o hello hello.c -lm
```

`-g`: When used, GCC includes extra data in the compiled output, such as symbol names, types, source file names, and line numbers.
This information is crucial for debuggers like GDB, allowing developers to step through code, inspect variables, and understand the program's execution flow.


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Working with multiple files

This all looks a bit different if we have our code split across files.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we will make a new file `main.c`

```bash

 nano main.c
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
with content as follows
```C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation.
Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992
Modified:
*/

#include <stdio.h>

void main () {
 int n;
 printf("Please enter a small positive integer: ");
 scanf("%d", &n);
 printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
 printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
}
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Then `help.c` 
```bash

 nano help.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation

Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992
Modified:

*/

/* Requires that "n" be positive. Returns the sum of the
  first "n" integers. */

int sum (int n) {
 int i;
 int total = 0;
 for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  total += i;
 return(total);
}


/* Requires that "n" be positive. Returns the product of the
  first "n" integers. */

int product (int n) {
 int i;
 int total = 1;
 for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  total *= i;
 return(total);
}
```





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we try again
```bash

 gcc -Wall -g -c main.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
main.c:10:6: warning: return type of ‘main’ is not ‘int’ [-Wmain]
 void main () {
      ^
main.c: In function ‘main’:
main.c:12:2: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘sum’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
  ^
main.c:13:2: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘product’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
  ^

```

we will leave only the one, which we will leave

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we preprocess, compile and assemble the helper code: 
```bash

 gcc -Wall -g -c help.c
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and look at what was created
```bash

 ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
demohello  hello.c  hello.o  help.c  main.c
hello      hello.i  hello.s  help.o  main.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

````{tip}
One reason we split code is to make it readable, but another reason is what we just did.  We can compile each file separately, when your code is large and compiling takes a long time, splitting it will mean you only have to recompile the file(s) you have recently changed and relink, instead of recompiling everything.
````
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and finally we link them.
```bash

 gcc -o demo main.o help.o -lm
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and then we can run
```bash

 ./demo
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```
Please enter a small positive integer: 5
The sum of the first n integers is 15
The product of the first n integers is 120
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
ls
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```bash
demo  hello  hello.c  help.c  help.o  main.c  main.o
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
Please enter a small positive integer: 6
The sum of the first n integers is 21
The product of the first n integers is 720
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
exit
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we can modify the code

```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int n = atoi(argv[1]);

    printf("The sum of the first %d integers is %d\n", n, sum(n));
    printf("The product of the first %d integers is %d\n", n, product(n));

    return 0;
}
```

Notice that now that we've fixed main.c we only need to recompile that. There is no need to recompile help.c since nothing changed in its code. We really just need the machine code of the new main and then we need to link both help.o with the new main.o. Let's call it main2.o


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```bash
gcc -o main2.o -gc main.c
gcc -o demo main2.o help.o -lm
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and then we can run
```bash

 ./demo
```
```
