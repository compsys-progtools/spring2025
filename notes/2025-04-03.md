## Loading a program

We're not going to *do* project 5, which is to **build** a CPU, but instead to use the test programs designed to check if a student's CPU works with the CPU Emulator they provide to *understand* a simple canonical CPU.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For more on how the emulator works see the [CPU Emulator Tutorial](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_24b3a15aa628404fbf6dacd86d7da3af.pdf).

For much more detail about how this all works [chapter 4](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_d70026d8c1424487a451eaba3e372132.pdf) of the related text book has description of the machine code and assembly language.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We're going to use the test cases from the book's project 5:

1. Load Program
2. Navigate to `nand2tetris/projects/05`

## How does the computer actually add constants?

We'll use `add.hack` first.  




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This program adds constants, 2+3.  

It is a program, assembly code that we are loading to the simulator's ROM, which is memory that gets read only by the CPU.  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Run the simulator and watch what each line of the program does.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Notice the following:
- to compute with a constant, that number only exists in ROM in the instructions
- to write a value to memory the address register first has to be pointed to where in the memory the value will go, then the value can be sent there



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The simulator has a few key parts:
- address register
- program counter



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If you prefer to read, see [section 5.2.1- 5.2.6 of nan2tetris book](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_b2cad2eea33847869b86c541683551a7.pdf)



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

- This program the first instruction puts 2 in the address register from the instructions in ROM.  
- Then it moves the 2 through the ALU to the data register (D)
- then it puts 3 on the address register
- then it adds the numbers at D and A
- then it puts 0 on the address register
- then it write the output from the ALU (D) to memory (at the location indicated by the A register)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## The max between two numbers

To compute the maximum value `max.hack`:
- subtracts  the two numbers
- compares the difference to 0
- jumps to different lines based on if it is >0 or not
- assigns the address regiter a value accordingly
- copies one of the two values to the new location
  

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Explore ideas 
Create some experiments in the simulator and write new programs.  Here are some ideas, but you can try anything you are curious about. 
- What line do you change to change where it outputs the data?
- How could you add a third number?
- How could you add two pairs, saving the intermediate numbers?
- How could you do (4+4)*(3+2)?

## Why is the object file not human readable?  


https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-code/9780596510046/ch17.html#from_code_to_pointers

The object file displayed as random weird characters because it is written to disk in a different format than our terminal reads it in.
It is the specific instructions (from the assembly) and memory addresses written to a file in binary.
Our terminal reads it one byte (8bits) at a time and interprets those as characters.

Today, we will see how characters are represented as integers, then binary, and read and write files in binary of strings we know to see how it what happens and mimic something like how that object file happened by writing as binary and then reading it as characters.  



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Prelude: REPL

One way we can use many interpreted languages, including Python is to treat the interpreter like an application and then interact with it in the terminal.  




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is called the Read, Execute, Print Loop or REPL.

We can execute simple expressions like mathemeatical expressions:


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```Python
4+5
```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and it will print the result
```
9
```





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can create variables
```python
name = 'ayman'
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

but assignment does not return anything, so nothing is printed.

We can see the value of a variable, by typing its name



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
name
```
and then it prints the value



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
'ayman'

```




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Characters to Integers


Python provides a builtin function [`ord`](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/functions.html?highlight=ord#ord) to find the Unicode key for a character.

```{code-cell} python
 ord('A')
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


This structure, the `[]` is called a list comprehension. It
executes a `for` loop in order to build a `list`.  In the REPL,
it will then print out the list.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


```
[ord(char) for char in name]
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We get the integer representation for each one.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Note that it's important to try multiple things if you aren't sure the format you are getting back or to check the official documents, as Denno found by testing this with his name in lowercase.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
[ord(char) for char in 'denno']
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Coincidentally, the letters in his name all fall into the hundreds and only require 0 and 1 in decimal, so it looks like they could be 3 bit binary numbers.
```
[100, 101, 110, 110, 111]

```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Python also allows us to change content into a byte array:

```
bytearray(34)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

It does not display in the 0 and 1 like a string that we might expect, but it does change the type.
```
bytearray(b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00')

```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can then write this to a file, by getting the actual bytes of each item.
First, we will save our list in a variable.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will use the Python `with` keyword to open the file so that we do not to need to separately open and close the file.
in the `open` function, the first parameter is the file name and the second is the mode.  In this case, we want to write ('w') in binary ('b'). `f` is the filestream.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
name_ints = [ord(char) for char in name]
with open("name.txt",'wb') as f:
     f.write(bytes(bytearray(name_ints)))
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

it returns 5 in this case, because it wrote out 5 bytes, one per character.
```
5
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we exit python we can look at the file and see how it is interpreted.
```
exit()
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Remember we wrote, as binary, the numbers, `97, 121, 109, 97, 110` to the file
```
cat name.txt
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

but it is interpretted as the string  by the terminal.

```
ayman
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
python
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Back in Python, we can read the file as binary
```
with open("name.txt",'rb') as f:
    print(f.read())  
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is binary, but the python interpreter also *prints* it as a string, the `b` indicates the object is actually binary type.
```
b'ayman'

```




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we read it not as binary, it returns as the string
```
with open("name.txt",'r') as f:
    print(f.read())
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
ayman

```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can also confirm the type
```
with open("name.txt",'rb') as f:
    content = f.read()

```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
type(content)
<class 'bytes'>

```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The with keyword is alternative to:

```
f = open("name.txt",'rb')
f.read()
f.close()

```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Practice exercise

```
msg = [65, 121, 109, 97, 110, 32, 83, 97, 110, 100, 111, 117, 107, 10]

```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```
bytes(bytearray(msg))
b'Ayman Sandouk\n'
```
