# Getting Organized for class


The only **required** things are in the Tools section of the syllabus, but this
organizational structure will help keep you on top of what is going on.  


 Your username will be
appended to the end of of the repository name for each of your assignments in
class.

## File structure


I recommend the following organization structure for the course:

```
CSC3392
  |- kwl-
  |- gh-inclass
  |- semYYYY
  |- ...
```

This is one top level folder will all materials in it.  A folder inside that for
in class notes, and one folder per repository.  

Please **do not** include all of your notes or your other assignments all inside
your portflio, it will make it harder to grade.

## Finding repositories on github

Each assignment repository will be created on GitHub with the `compsys-progtools`
organization as the owner, not your personal acount. Since your account is not
the owner, they do not show on your profile.


If you go to the main page of the [organization](https://github.com/compsys-progtools)
you can search by your username (or the first few characters of it) and see
only your repositories.
